# Progress Logging Requirement

For meaningful implementation changes, update both files in the same session:

- `PROGRESS.md` with detailed engineering context
- `PROGRESS_SUMMARY.md` with concise summary
- Use Pacific time for dates/timestamps: `America/Los_Angeles` (PST/PDT seasonally). For date-only entries, use the Pacific calendar date.

Follow `docs/PROGRESS_LOGGING_PROTOCOL.md`.

Do not mark work complete without both updates.
