## Writing Guidelines

| Rule | Why |
|------|-----|
| 150 words/minute | Natural pacing, room to breathe |
| Max 20 words/sentence | Easy to follow, clear audio |
| Active voice | "The system detects..." not "Detection is performed..." |
| Specific > vague | "50ms response time" beats "blazing fast" |
| Benefits > features | "Ship faster" beats "CI/CD integration" |
| One idea per scene | Don't overload |

---

## Transitions Between Scenes

Keep transitions short (0.5-1 sec). Options:
- Clean cut (professional)
- Fade (softer)
- Slide (modern)

Avoid: Heavy effects, star wipes, anything that dates the video.

---

## Audio Notes

- **Voice:** Clear, professional, matches audience
- **Music:** Light background at -20dB (doesn't compete)
- **Pacing:** Leave 0.5s pause between scenes for breathing room
- **Emphasis:** Slow down slightly for key terms/product name
