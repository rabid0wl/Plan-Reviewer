## Search Strategy by Situation

| Situation | Best Search |
|-----------|-------------|
| Don't know what platform the city uses | `"City of [Name]" municipal code` on Google |
| Need the ADU ordinance specifically | `"City of [Name]" municipal code accessory dwelling unit` |
| Need the building code adoption chapter | Look for Title 15 or Title 20 in the code TOC — usually named "Buildings and Construction" or "Building Regulations" |
| Need local amendments to CBC/CRC | Within the building code title, look for chapters titled "Amendments to California Building Code" or similar |
| Need the grading ordinance | Search the code for "grading" or look in the building code title for a grading chapter |
| Need the zoning/ADU chapter | Look in the zoning title (often Title 17 or Title 23) for "Accessory Dwelling" chapter |

## Common Municipal Code Structure (California Cities)

Most California city municipal codes follow a similar structure:

| Title Number (varies) | Common Name | What's In It |
|----------------------|-------------|--------------|
| Title 1-5 | General Provisions / Administration | City organization, penalties, general rules |
| Title 8-12 | Health & Safety / Public Peace | Noise, animals, nuisance abatement |
| Title 13-14 | Public Services / Utilities | Water, sewer service, storm drains |
| **Title 15-20** | **Buildings & Construction** | **CBC/CRC/CPC/CEC/CMC adoption, local amendments, grading** |
| **Title 17-23** | **Zoning** | **Land use, development standards, ADU ordinance** |
| Title 18 | Fire Protection | Fire code adoption |

**Note**: Title numbers vary significantly by city. The content grouping is more consistent than the numbering.

## Tips

- **"Current through Ordinance [#]"**: This tells you how up-to-date the online code is. If the ordinance number is old, the code may not reflect recent changes.
- **Supplement dates**: Municode shows "Supp. No. [X]" — check the supplement date to verify currency.
- **Local amendments are the gold**: The base code adoptions just say "the California Building Code is adopted." The amendments sections contain the city-specific stuff that actually matters for corrections letters.
- **Cross-reference with corrections**: When a corrections letter says "City of [Name] Municipal Code" — it's referring to these local amendments and ordinances, not the state codes themselves.
