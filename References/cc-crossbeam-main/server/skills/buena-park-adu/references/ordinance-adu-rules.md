  - Corner lot with second driveway on side street AND no loss of on-street parking
- No passageway to street required
- ADU/JADU must have independent exterior access from existing residence

### C.11 — Way Finding

Address display per current CRC as adopted/amended by city.

### C.12 — Utilities

- May be metered with primary dwelling (per Gov. Code § 65852.2(f))
- **Note**: Ordinance still references old 65852.2(f) — should be Gov. Code § 66324. See `hcd-compliance.md` Finding #3 on outdated numbering.

### C.13 — Restricted Areas

- No ADU/JADU where roadways, utilities, and services are inadequate per objective/published thresholds
- **OCFA road width standards**: ADU prohibited on lots fronting roads narrower than OCFA Master Plans minimum UNLESS:
  - (a) 1 on-site parking space per bedroom, AND
  - (b) replacement parking for any spaces lost/converted, OR
  - (c) CUP per § 19.128.020 with findings on adequate street access/traffic and utilities

See `fire-ocfa.md` for OCFA road width requirements and screening form.

### C.14 — Building and Fire Codes

- Comply with all current state and local building/fire codes
- **Fire sprinklers**: NOT required for ADU/JADU if not required for primary residence
- ADU construction alone shall NOT trigger sprinkler requirement in existing main dwelling

See `fire-ocfa.md` for OCFA-specific triggers that may require sprinklers regardless.

### C.15 — Park Fees

- ADUs >= 750 sq ft: proportionate Park Land Dedications and In-Lieu Fees per adopted Development Impact Fee Schedule (Ch. 18.64)
- ADUs < 750 sq ft: **exempt** from park fees (per state law § 66311.5)

See `fees-impacts.md` for full fee schedule.

### C.16 — Objective Design Standards

**Match primary dwelling**:
- Roofing material and roof design (slope, style)
- Fascia
- Exterior building finish and color
- Exterior doors, windows, garage door
- Architectural enhancements

**Garage conversion**: Visible garage door must be eliminated and replaced with architecturally consistent wall/windows/door.

**Privacy**: Second story windows and glass doors must use offset/clerestory placement or opaque/view-obscuring glass.

**Manufactured homes**:
- Skirting required for grade appearance
- Synthetic materials OK if similar appearance and equivalent durability
- Siding from grade to roof (exception: approved perimeter foundation)

**State law comparison**: These are **objective standards** (measurable, verifiable) which cities may impose per Gov. Code § 66314(b)(1). Buena Park's design match requirements are more detailed than many cities but are within their rights.

ADU cannot be sold separately from primary residence.
