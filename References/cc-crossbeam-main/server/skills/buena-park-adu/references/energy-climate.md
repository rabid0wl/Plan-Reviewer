## Energy Code — Buena Park (Climate Zone 8)

### Climate Zone

**Buena Park is in California Climate Zone 8** for Title 24 energy code purposes.

Zone 8 covers much of coastal/near-coastal Southern California including: Irvine, Tustin, Orange, Placentia, Norwalk, Stanton, Downey, Cypress, Fullerton, Anaheim, Brea, Aliso Viejo, Yorba Linda, and surrounding cities.

### Title 24 Energy Code

Plans submitted after January 1, 2026 must comply with the **2025 Energy Code** (Title 24 Part 6).

### Key Prescriptive Requirements for Climate Zone 8 ADUs

#### Roof/Ceiling (Vented Attic)
- U-factor: at most 0.025 (R-38+ insulation for wood-framed)
- If ducts in unconditioned attic: roof deck U-factor at most 0.184 (R-5 above or below deck)

#### Walls (Above Grade, Framed)
- Max U-factor: 0.051
- **Option A**: 2x6 @ 16" OC with R-19 cavity + R-5 continuous rigid
- **Option B**: 2x4 @ 16" OC with R-15 cavity + R-8 continuous rigid

#### ADU as Addition (relaxed requirements)
- If treated as an "addition" rather than new construction, some prescriptive requirements are relaxed
- Existing 2x6 walls may use **R-21 cavity insulation only** (no continuous insulation required)
- Continuous insulation not required on existing walls being retained

#### Solar PV
- CalGreen/Title 24 solar requirements apply to new construction ADUs
- Solar PV may be required for ADUs over certain size thresholds (depends on whether classified as new construction vs. addition)
