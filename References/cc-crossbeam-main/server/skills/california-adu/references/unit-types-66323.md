## 66323 Units — Four State-Mandated ADU Categories

HCD uses "66323 Units" to refer to ADUs and JADUs created under Government Code section 66323. Also called "state-mandated" or "state-exempt" ADUs. These must be approved ministerially and are **not subject to standards in Gov. Code §§ 66314–66322** — meaning they do not have to comply with lot coverage, front setbacks, or design standards. They must comply with building code and health and safety requirements for dwellings. (Gov. Code, § 66323, subds. (a), (b).)

### The Four Categories

#### Category 1: Single-Family Converted ADUs and JADUs — § 66323(a)(1)

- **One ADU per lot** within converted space of a proposed or existing single-family dwelling or accessory structure.
- Must have exterior access and setbacks for fire and safety.
- **Not subject to 4-foot side/rear setback** requirement.
- ADUs converted from accessory structures may expand up to **150 sq ft** for ingress/egress (e.g., adding a stairwell). (Gov. Code, § 66323, subd. (a)(1)(A).)
- **One JADU per lot** is also permitted within the proposed or existing space of the single-family dwelling or accessory structure. Must have exterior access and side/rear setbacks for fire and safety. (Gov. Code, § 66323, subd. (a)(1).)
- JADUs must also comply with JADU Law (Gov. Code, §§ 66333–66339). Attached garages count as part of the single-family dwelling for JADU purposes. (Gov. Code, § 66333, subd. (d).)
- **Note**: A JADU may only be created within the walls of the single-family residence, not within an accessory structure. JADUs may not expand beyond the existing dimensions of the dwelling.

#### Category 2: Single-Family Detached ADUs — § 66323(a)(2)

- **One detached new-construction ADU** per lot with an existing or proposed single-family dwelling.
- Subject to **4-foot side and rear yard setbacks**.
- Maximum unit size: **800 sq ft**.
- Height limits: **16, 18, or 20 feet** depending on conditions in Gov. Code § 66321, subd. (b)(4).
- May be located in the front setback.

#### Category 3: Multifamily Converted ADUs — § 66323(a)(3)

- ADUs created within portions of **existing multifamily structures not used as livable space** (e.g., storage rooms, boiler rooms, passageways, attics, basements, garages). (Gov. Code, § 66323, subd. (a)(3)(A).)
- Local agencies must allow **at least one ADU** within an existing multifamily dwelling and **up to 25% of existing units**. (Gov. Code, § 66323, subd. (a)(3)(B).)

#### Category 4: Multifamily Detached ADUs — § 66323(a)(4)

- **Proposed multifamily dwelling**: Up to **2 detached ADUs**.
- **Existing multifamily dwelling**: Up to **8 detached ADUs**, not to exceed the number of existing units on the lot.
- Subject to **4-foot rear and side yard setbacks**.
- Height limits: **16, 18, or 20 feet** depending on conditions in Gov. Code § 66321, subd. (b)(4).
- A local agency may not require setback modifications for an existing multifamily dwelling with setbacks less than 4 feet. (Gov. Code, § 66323, subd. (a)(4)(B).)

### Combinations Table

Local agencies must allow 66323 categories to be combined as allowed by site and lot conditions. SB 543 specifies the number of allowable ADUs described under § 66323 per lot. (Changed by SB 543, effective January 1, 2026.) (Gov. Code, § 66323, subd. (a).)

| Code Section | Single-Family Primary Dwelling | Multifamily Primary Dwelling |
|---|---|---|
| **§ 66323(a)(1) — Converted from existing space** | One ADU from converted space. May expand 150 sq ft from accessory structure for ingress/egress. Must have exterior access. | Does not apply |
| **§§ 66323(a)(1); 66333–66339 — JADUs** | One JADU within existing or proposed dwelling. 500 sq ft max. May be created from attached garage. | Does not apply |
| **§ 66323(a)(2) — Detached new construction** | One detached ADU. May be in front setback. 800 sq ft max. | Does not apply |
| **§ 66323(a)(3) — Converted from non-livable space** | Does not apply | At least one ADU or up to 25% of existing units, from non-livable space (gyms, enclosed parking, etc.) |
| **§ 66323(a)(4) — Detached from primary** | Does not apply | Up to 2 units (proposed MF) or up to 8 units (existing MF), not to exceed existing unit count. 4-ft side/rear setbacks. |

**Single-family lot**: Must allow (a)(1) + (a)(2) together = one converted ADU + one JADU + one detached ADU.

**Multifamily lot**: Must allow (a)(3) + (a)(4) together = converted ADUs (at least 1 or up to 25%) + detached ADUs (up to 2 or 8).

### Standards That Apply to 66323 Units

- **No local design, zoning, or development standards** may be imposed beyond what § 66323 specifically lists — this includes parking, height, setbacks, lot size, open space, and FAR. (Gov. Code, § 66323, subds. (a), (b).)
- **Rental term**: Must be longer than 30 days. (Gov. Code, § 66323, subd. (e).)
- **Fire sprinklers**: Not required if not required for the primary residence. Construction of an ADU cannot trigger sprinkler requirements in an existing multifamily dwelling. (Gov. Code, § 66323, subd. (d).)
- **Nonconforming zoning**: A local agency cannot condition approval on correction of nonconforming zoning conditions. (Gov. Code, § 66323, subd. (c).)

### Expanding a Converted Accessory Structure

An ADU created within an existing accessory structure may expand up to **150 sq ft** beyond the physical dimensions solely for ingress/egress (e.g., a staircase to a second-story ADU). Must conform to setbacks sufficient for fire and safety. (Gov. Code, § 66323, subd. (a)(1)(A), (a)(1)(C).)
