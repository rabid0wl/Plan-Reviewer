## SB 9 Interaction with ADU Law

### How Does SB 9 Work with ADUs?

SB 9 (Gov. Code, §§ 65852.21, 66411.7) and State ADU Law are **complementary**. Both laws can be implemented in ways that result in developments with both "SB 9 Units" and ADUs.

### Four-Unit Cap

In **no case** does SB 9 require a local agency to allow more than **four units on a single lot**, in any combination of primary units and ADUs or JADUs. (Gov. Code, § 66411.7, subd. (j).)

### Scenarios

**No lot split:**
- The lot may receive a second primary unit under SB 9
- The lot may also receive up to **two ADUs** under State ADU Law
- Total: up to four units

**Lot split occurs under SB 9:**
- Each resulting lot is eligible for up to **two units** — for example, a primary unit and an ADU or JADU

**Lot split + two primary units on each resulting lot:**
- If the owner both splits a lot and builds two primary units on each resulting lot under SB 9, **State ADU Law is superseded** — neither lot is entitled to an ADU or JADU
- In all other cases, State ADU Law applies, up to SB 9's four-unit cap

### Complaints

Members of the public with SB 9 complaints are encouraged to share them through the Housing Accountability Unit Portal. See also HCD's SB 9 Fact Sheet.
