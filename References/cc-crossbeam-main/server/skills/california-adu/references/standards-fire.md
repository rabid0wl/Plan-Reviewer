## Fire Protection and Sprinkler Requirements

### When Are Sprinklers Required?

Fire sprinklers are required for an ADU **only when sprinklers are required for the existing primary residence**. Installation of fire sprinklers shall not be required in attached, detached, or converted ADUs if sprinklers are not required by building codes for the existing primary residence. (Gov. Code, § 66314, subd. (d)(12).)

### Key Scenarios

**Sprinklers NOT required:**
- A detached single-family home designed and constructed decades ago that was not required to have fire sprinklers under the applicable building code at the time — any ADU on that lot does not need sprinklers.

**Sprinklers ARE required:**
- If the same primary dwelling recently underwent significant alteration and is now required to have fire sprinklers, any ADU created after that alteration must have sprinklers.

### JADUs — Fire Sprinkler Exemption

Fire sprinklers are **not required for a JADU** if the primary residence does not have fire sprinklers. The addition of a JADU **cannot trigger** the requirement for fire sprinklers. (Changed by SB 543, effective January 1, 2026.) (Gov. Code, § 66323, subd. (d).)

### No Trigger for Primary Residence

Construction of an ADU or JADU **shall not trigger** a requirement for fire sprinklers for the primary residence. If a primary dwelling currently does not have fire sprinklers and an attached ADU is proposed that would trigger sprinkler requirements due to the increase in livable space, that requirement **shall not be imposed upon the primary dwelling unit**. (Gov. Code, §§ 66314, subd. (d)(12); 66323, subd. (d).)

### Multifamily Dwellings

Construction of an ADU under Gov. Code § 66323 **shall not trigger** a requirement for fire sprinklers for an existing multifamily dwelling. (Gov. Code, § 66323, subd. (d).)

### Fire Access and Safety Setbacks

While sprinklers follow the primary residence rule, all ADUs must still comply with applicable **building code and health and safety requirements** for dwellings, which may include fire access and safety provisions. 66323 converted ADUs must have **exterior access** and setbacks sufficient for **fire and safety**. (Gov. Code, § 66323, subd. (a)(1).)
