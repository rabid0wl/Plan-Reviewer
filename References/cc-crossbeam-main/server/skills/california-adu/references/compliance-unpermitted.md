## Unpermitted ADUs and Legalization

### Can a Local Agency Deny a Permit for an Unpermitted ADU Built Before January 1, 2020?

**No.** Local agencies may not deny a permit for an unpermitted ADU or JADU created prior to **January 1, 2020**. (Gov. Code, § 66332, subd. (a).)

However, the local agency **may** deny a permit if it finds that the building is **substandard** pursuant to Health and Safety Code section 17920.3. This does not preclude the local agency from pursuing enforcement action on violations, and the applicant may be required to make alterations or repairs accordingly. (Gov. Code, § 66332.)

### Inspection Process

An inspector from the local agency may:
1. Inspect the unit for compliance with **health and safety standards**
2. Provide **recommendations** to comply with those standards
3. If noncompliance is found, the local agency **shall not penalize** the applicant for having the unpermitted ADU or JADU
4. The local agency **shall approve** necessary permits to correct noncompliance with health and safety standards

(Gov. Code, § 66332, subd. (f).)

### Public Information Requirements

A local agency **shall inform the public** about the unpermitted ADU provisions through public information resources, including permit checklists and the agency's website, which must include:

1. A **checklist** of the conditions specified in HSC § 17920.3 that would deem a building substandard
2. Information that the homeowner may obtain a **confidential third-party code inspection** from a licensed contractor before applying for a permit

(Gov. Code, § 66332, subds. (d)(1), (d)(2).)

### Fee Exemptions for Unpermitted ADUs

A homeowner applying for a permit for a previously unpermitted ADU or JADU constructed before January 1, 2020, **shall not be required to pay** impact fees or connection or capacity charges if the homeowner provides written evidence that their household income does not exceed the definition of a **low- or moderate-income household** (HSC, § 50093). (Gov. Code, § 66332, subd. (e).)

### Five-Year Enforcement Delay

Upon application and approval, a local agency shall **delay enforcement** against a qualifying substandard ADU for **five years** to allow the owner to correct the violation, so long as the violation is **not a health and safety issue** as determined by the enforcement agency. (Gov. Code, § 66331; HSC, § 17980.12.)
