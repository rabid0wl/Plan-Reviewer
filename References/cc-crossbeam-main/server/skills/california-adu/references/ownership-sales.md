## Separate Conveyance, Condominiums, and Qualified Nonprofits

### Can ADUs Be Sold Separately?

Generally, ADUs cannot be sold or conveyed separately from the primary dwelling unit. However, there are two narrow exceptions created by statute:

### 1. Condominium Conversion (Local Ordinance — AB 1033)

A local agency may adopt an ordinance to allow **separate conveyance of the primary unit and the ADU as condominiums** if the ordinance meets the specific requirements laid out in Government Code section 66342.

This means:
- Separate sale is **not automatic** — the local agency must opt in by adopting a qualifying ordinance
- The ordinance must comply with the requirements of § 66342
- Where adopted, the ADU and primary dwelling can be individually owned as condominiums

### 2. Qualified Nonprofit Exception

Government Code section 66341 creates a narrow exception to allow **separate conveyance of an ADU to a qualified buyer** when:

- The property was **built or developed by a qualified nonprofit corporation**
- The transaction meets other requirements specified in section 66341

### JADU Sales Restriction

JADUs may **never** be sold separately from the single-family residence. The deed restriction required for JADUs explicitly prohibits separate sale. (Gov. Code, § 66333, subds. (c)(1), (c)(2).)
