## Funding and Financing for ADUs

### CalHFA ADU Grant Program

The California Housing Finance Agency (CalHFA) ADU Grant Program provided up to **$40,000** in assistance to reimburse qualifying homeowners for **predevelopment costs** necessary to build an ADU or JADU on a lot with an owner-occupied single-family dwelling.

**Eligible predevelopment costs** include, but are not limited to:
- Architectural designs
- Permits
- Soil tests
- Impact fees
- Property surveys
- Energy reports

**Note:** At the time of the handbook's publication (January 2025), CalHFA ADU Grant funds had been exhausted. Check the HCD ADU webpage for current availability.

### HCD Funding Programs for Local Agencies

Local agencies seeking funding for ADU/JADU programs may apply through several HCD programs that include ADU/JADU housing types as eligible activities:

- **CalHome Program**
- **Permanent Local Housing Allocation (PLHA) Program**
- **Prohousing Incentive Program**
- **Local Housing Trust Fund Program**

Some local agencies are also independently creating funding opportunities for ADU/JADU predevelopment and construction costs, or waiving fees.
