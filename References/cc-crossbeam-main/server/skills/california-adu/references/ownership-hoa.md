## HOA Restrictions and CC&R Nullification

### Can CC&Rs Prohibit ADUs or JADUs?

**No.** Civil Code sections 714.3 and 4751 **nullify** CC&Rs that either effectively prohibit or unreasonably restrict the construction or use of an ADU or JADU on lots zoned to permit single-family residential uses. Such CC&Rs — including operating rules — are **void and unenforceable**.

Applicants who encounter ADU prohibitions in CC&Rs, whether implicit or explicit, are encouraged to reach out to their local agency. (Civ. Code, §§ 714.3; 4751.)

### What Restrictions Can HOAs Impose?

HOAs may impose **limited objective standards**, such as:
- Requiring specific materials (within reason)
- Architectural styles
- Other design and aesthetic restrictions

However, these standards may **not** be more stringent than State ADU Law and may not:
- Unreasonably increase the cost to construct
- Effectively prohibit or extinguish the ability to create or serve an ADU or JADU
- **Include any fees or other financial requirements** (Changed by AB 130, effective June 30, 2025.)

(Civ. Code, § 714.3, subd. (b).)

### Examples of Prohibited HOA Actions

The following may constitute effective prohibitions, unreasonable costs, or extinguishments:

- **Timeline delays** — Any HOA review delay beyond the 60-day timeframe required of local agencies, or that significantly delays construction or use
- **Costly alterations** — Requiring changes that cause the property owner to incur substantial costs or forgo development
- **Re-application mandates** — Imposing conditions that necessitate re-applying or amending a building permit that substantially complies with State ADU Law
- **Neighbor approval** — Mandating neighboring property owners' approval or considering neighbor disagreement as part of the ministerial process
- **Infeasible placement** — Restricting placement or location such that the ADU would be rendered infeasible or unusable
- **Major structural changes** — Requiring structural elements or design changes beyond State ADU Law that would extinguish the ability to construct
- **Non-objective restrictions** — Imposing restrictions that are not objective or not knowable in advance of application submission
- **Excessive fees** — Levying excessive application fees, conditions, or financial requirements (such as requiring owner-occupancy of an ADU or charging disproportionate maintenance fees)

### Can an HOA Influence the Local Agency's Approval Process?

**No.** An HOA may not influence a local agency's ministerial approval of an ADU or JADU. Local agencies must provide an approval process that includes **only ministerial provisions**. Third-party reviews by an HOA or their representatives would **violate State ADU Law**. (Gov. Code, §§ 66315; 66317, subd. (c).)

No other local ordinances, policies, or regulations may be applied in the approval or denial of an ADU or JADU permit application. (Gov. Code, § 66317, subd. (c).)

If a local agency allows an HOA to be involved in any part of an ADU or JADU application process, **the local agency is in violation of State ADU Law**.

### Remedies

Property owners whose construction or use of an ADU or JADU is impeded by an HOA (or their representatives or agents) are encouraged to:
1. Reach out to their local agency
2. Seek legal counsel
