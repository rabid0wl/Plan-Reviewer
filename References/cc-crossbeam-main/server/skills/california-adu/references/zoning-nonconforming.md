## Nonconforming Zoning and Building Code Violations

### Nonconforming Zoning Conditions

**Can a local agency refuse to permit an ADU because of nonconforming zoning conditions?**

No. State ADU Law limits a local agency's ability to deny a permit application due to existing nonconforming zoning conditions. Nonconforming zoning conditions are physical improvements on a property that do not conform to current zoning standards. (Gov. Code, § 66313, subd. (h).)

**For 66323 Units:** A local agency **cannot condition approval** on the correction of nonconforming zoning conditions. (Gov. Code, § 66323, subd. (c).)

**For all other ADUs:** A local agency may deny a permit due to zoning nonconformance **only when** the nonconformance creates a **threat to public health and safety** and is **affected by the construction of the ADU**. (Gov. Code, § 66322, subd. (b).)

### Building Code Violations on the Primary Unit

**Can an ADU application be denied due to building code violations?**

An ADU application pursuant to Government Code section 66314 may be denied due to building code violations on the primary unit **only if**:

1. The violations present a **threat to public health and safety**, AND
2. The violations are **affected by the construction of the ADU**

(Gov. Code, § 66322, subd. (b).)

All ADUs must comply with building code and health and safety requirements for dwellings regardless.
