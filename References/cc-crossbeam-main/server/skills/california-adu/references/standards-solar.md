## Solar and Energy Code Requirements

### Are Solar Systems Required for Newly Constructed ADUs?

**Yes**, with conditions. Newly constructed ADUs are subject to the California Energy Code requirement to provide solar systems if the unit is a **newly constructed, detached ADU** (some exceptions apply). (Title 24, California Energy Code.)

- Solar systems can be installed on the ADU **or** on the primary dwelling unit.
- **Manufactured homes** are excluded from this requirement.

### When Solar Is NOT Required

ADUs that are constructed within existing space, or as an addition to existing homes — including detached additions where an existing detached building is converted from non-residential to residential space — are **not subject** to the California Energy Code requirement to provide solar systems.

In summary:
- **New detached construction** — solar required
- **Converted from existing space** (garage, basement, etc.) — solar NOT required
- **Addition to existing home** (attached ADU) — solar NOT required
- **Manufactured homes** — solar NOT required
