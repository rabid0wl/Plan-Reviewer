## Height Limits by ADU Type

### Does State Law Set a Height Limit?

State ADU Law does not contain a height limit itself, but it sets **minimum heights that local agencies must allow**. A local agency may impose height limits by adopting a compliant ADU ordinance, but may not go below the state-mandated minimums. (Gov. Code, § 66321, subd. (b)(4).)

### Detached ADU Height Limits

A local agency may not impose a height limit less than:

| Scenario | Minimum Height | Code Section |
|---|---|---|
| **Base** — lot with proposed or existing SF or MF dwelling | **16 feet** | § 66321(b)(4)(A) |
| **Near transit** — within half-mile of major transit stop or high-quality transit corridor | **18 feet** (includes +2 ft for roof pitch matching primary dwelling) | § 66321(b)(4)(B) |
| **Multistory primary** — lot with existing or proposed multifamily, multistory dwelling | **18 feet** | § 66321(b)(4)(C) |

### Attached ADU Height Limits

**25 feet** or the height limitation that applies to the primary dwelling in the local zoning ordinance, **whichever is lower**. (Gov. Code, § 66321, subd. (b)(4)(D).)

### Number of Stories

There is **no limit on the number of stories** in State ADU Law. A local agency must allow at least **two stories**. An attached ADU may be built to the height of the zoning for the primary dwelling or up to 25 feet, whichever is lower. (Gov. Code, § 66321, subd. (b)(4)(D).)

If a detached two-story ADU can be built within the allowed height while remaining compliant with building code, a local agency **cannot deny the application** — even if underlying zoning restricts the primary dwelling to one story. (Gov. Code, §§ 66321, subd. (b)(4)(D); 66314, subd. (d)(8).)

### 66323 Unit Height Limits

For 66323 Units (state-mandated ADUs under § 66323(a)(2) and (a)(4)), the same height limits apply: **16, 18, or 20 feet** for detached units depending on the conditions above. No additional local height standards may be imposed beyond what § 66323 specifically authorizes. (Gov. Code, § 66323, subds. (a), (b).)

### Determining Transit Proximity

The California State Geoportal features an interactive map and searchable database to assess whether an address is within a High-Quality Transit Corridor (HQTC). However, State ADU Law does not designate a definitive resource. Applicants should check with their Metropolitan Planning Organization first, then their local agency. (Gov. Code, § 66321, subd. (b)(4)(B).)
