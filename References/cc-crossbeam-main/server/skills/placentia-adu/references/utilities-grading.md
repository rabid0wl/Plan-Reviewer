### ADU Water Connection Impact (GSWC)

When adding an ADU to existing GSWC water service:
- **Option A:** Keep single service connection → rate reclassified from Single-Family to Multi-Family (higher rate); may require larger meter and higher service charge
- **Option B:** Separate second water service → both units stay on SFR rate, but all costs for second service at customer's expense

> **Important:** This is a significant cost consideration. Discuss options with GSWC before finalizing ADU design.

### ADU Utility Connection Rules (§ 23.73.060)

| ADU Type | New Connection Required? | Connection Fee? |
|----------|------------------------|-----------------|
| Within existing SFR or existing accessory structure | **No** | **No** fee or capacity charge |
| New construction ADU | **Yes** | **Proportionate** (based on size or plumbing fixtures) |
| JADU | **No** (not considered separate dwelling for utilities) | **No** |

All utility installations must be underground.

### Stormwater / NPDES

**Regulatory framework:**
- Part of **North Orange County Stormwater Program**
- Authority: Santa Ana Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB)
- Permit: Phase I MS4 Permit
- Municipal Code: Title 16, Chapter 16.20
- City operates two drainage systems: sanitary sewers (treated) and storm drains (untreated)

**Development requirements:**
- Non-exempt **Priority Development Projects** must prepare a **Water Quality Management Plan (WQMP)** before grading or building permit
- **Low Impact Development (LID)** principles required — site design to mimic pre-development hydrology
- WQMP template available from city

**Construction stormwater (CGP):**
- Projects disturbing **1 acre or more** require state Construction General Permit (CGP)
- Requires SWPPP prepared by Qualified SWPPP Practitioner (QSP)
- Most single ADU projects are well under 1 acre → CGP typically **NOT triggered**

### Grading

- Placentia has its **own grading code** (Chapter 20.40) — NOT the OC County grading code
- No grading without a permit from the city engineer
- Contact: Public Works Engineering at (714) 993-8131

**ADU-specific note:** Public Works materials (grading permit documentation, soils report, utility plan) must be submitted BEFORE building plan check begins.

### Infrastructure Master Plans
- Storm Drain Master Plan (2023)
- Sanitary Sewer Master Plan (2018)
