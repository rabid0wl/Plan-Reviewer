## ADU Operational Rules — Placentia

### Owner Occupancy (§ 23.73.070)

**ADUs:** State law (AB 976) permanently prohibits cities from imposing owner-occupancy requirements on ADUs. No owner-occupancy required regardless of permit date.

**JADUs:** Owner MUST occupy either the primary unit or the JADU. Exceptions:
- Government agencies, land trusts, or housing organizations as owners
- Renting both primary and JADU to a single party with no sublease

> **Note:** Placentia's code still references the 2020-2025 exemption period. State law now permanently bars ADU owner-occupancy requirements.

### Impact Fees (§ 23.73.070)

| ADU Size | Impact Fees |
|----------|------------|
| Under 750 sq ft | **EXEMPT** from all development impact fees |
| 750 sq ft+ (SF lot) | (Full SF DIF) × (ADU sq ft / Primary dwelling sq ft) |
| 750 sq ft+ (MF lot) | (Full MF DIF) × (ADU sq ft / Average MF unit sq ft) |
| JADU within existing SFR | **EXEMPT** from citywide DIFs |
| JADU new construction/addition | Full single-family DIF rate |

- "Impact fee" has the same meaning as Government Code § 65852.2(f)
- All applicable fees paid prior to occupancy

### Deed Restriction (Required Before Permit)

A deed restriction must be:
- Filed with the county recorder
- Approved by the city attorney
- Recorded BEFORE building permit issuance

**Deed restriction must state:**
1. ADU shall not be sold separately from primary dwelling
2. ADU restrictions binding on all successors in ownership
3. Non-compliance results in legal action
4. If owner-occupancy applies (JADU), covenant must state that requirement

### Sale Restrictions

- ADU **cannot be sold separately** from the primary residence
- Placentia has **NOT** opted into AB 1033 (which would allow separate ADU sale to qualifying buyers)

### Short-Term Rental (§ 23.73.070)

- ADU shall not be rented for **less than 30 consecutive calendar days**
- If rental term less than 30 days is requested, written documentation required showing special circumstances
- City has a **moratorium on short-term rental permits through September 1, 2026**
- ADUs have the same STR limitations as the primary residence

### Utility Connections (§ 23.73.060)

| ADU Type | New Connection Required? | Connection Fee? |
|----------|------------------------|-----------------|
| Within existing SFR or existing accessory structure | **No** | **No** connection fee or capacity charge |
| New construction ADU (all other types) | **Yes** — new/separate connection required | **Proportionate** to burden (based on size or plumbing fixtures) |

- All utility installations must be underground
- Adequate water and sewer service required

### Mandatory Approvals (§ 23.73.080)

The city MUST ministerially approve these categories:

**1. Conversion within existing SF home or accessory structure:**
- One ADU or JADU
- Must have independent exterior access
- Side and rear setbacks sufficient for fire and safety
- JADU must comply with § 23.73.090

**2. Small detached on SF lot:**
- Max 800 sq ft
- Max 16 ft height
- 4 ft side and rear setbacks
- A JADU may ALSO be on the same lot

**3. Multi-family lot conversion:**
- Up to 25% of existing units (min 1)
- Within non-livable space (storage, boiler rooms, passageways, attics, basements, garages)
- Each must meet state building standards

**4. Multi-family lot new detached:**
- Up to 2 detached units
- Max 16 ft height
- 4 ft side and rear setbacks

**Key rule:** For mandatory approval ADUs, city shall NOT require correction of legal nonconforming zoning conditions.

### JADU Requirements (§ 23.73.090)

| Requirement | Standard |
|-------------|----------|
| Maximum size | 500 sq ft |
| Location | Entirely within existing or proposed SFR |
| Kitchen | Required — efficiency kitchen (sink, cooking facility, food prep counter) |
| Bathroom | Optional — may share with primary (must have interior access if shared) |
| Entrance | Separate entrance from primary required |
| Parking | None required |
| Owner occupancy | Required — owner in either primary or JADU |

**JADU Deed Restriction (required before permit):**
1. No separate sale from primary
2. Cannot enlarge beyond 500 sq ft
3. No rental less than 31 consecutive calendar days
4. Owner occupancy required (with exceptions)
5. Binding on future purchasers; copy filed with Development Services

**JADU Utility Treatment:**
- NOT considered a separate/new dwelling unit for fire/life protection, water, sewer, or power
- No connection fees for JADU

### Enforcement (Until January 1, 2030)

- City issues statement with notice to correct ADU-related violations
- Owner may file application contesting if correction is not necessary for public health/safety
- City may delay enforcement for up to 5 years if ADU does not present a threat

### Unpermitted ADU Legalization

Properties with unpermitted ADUs/JADUs built before January 1, 2020 may apply for legalization permits using the HSC § 17920.3 checklist (per AB 2533).
