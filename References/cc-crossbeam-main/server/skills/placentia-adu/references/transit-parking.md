### ADU Transit Benefits

**Parking Exemption:**
ADUs within **½ mile walking distance** of public transit require **no additional parking**.

**What qualifies as "public transit":**
- Bus stops with regular service (OCTA routes qualify)
- Train stations (Metrolink)
- Even though the Metrolink station is not yet built, existing OCTA bus stops along routes serving Placentia already qualify

**Height Bonus (State Law):**
Per state law, if a property is within ½ mile walking distance of a major transit stop OR the existing building is 2 stories, the detached ADU is allowed up to **18 ft** height. Placentia's local code already allows **20 ft** for detached ADUs, which exceeds this bonus.

### How to Determine Transit Proximity

Walking distance is measured along the actual walking path (not straight-line "as the crow flies"):
1. Find the nearest OCTA bus stop to the property
2. Measure walking distance along streets/sidewalks
3. If ≤ 0.5 miles (2,640 ft), the parking exemption applies

### TOD Packing House District

**Key features:**

**Fee Exemptions in TOD:**
