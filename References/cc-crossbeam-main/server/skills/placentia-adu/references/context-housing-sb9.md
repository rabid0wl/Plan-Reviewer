### What This Means for ADU Approvals

With 4,374 units to add by 2029 and the city actively pursuing Prohousing Designation, Placentia has **strong political motivation to approve ADUs**. The city's Housing Element is certified and in good standing with HCD, which reduces regulatory risk for applicants.

## SB 9 in Placentia

### Chapter 23.69 — Two Unit Housing Developments

Placentia adopted SB 9 regulations via **Ordinance O-2024-05** (September 17, 2024).

**Key provisions:**
- A "housing development" = no more than 2 residential units in a single-family zone
- Two units may be two new units OR one new + one existing
- City shall **ministerially approve** qualifying two-unit developments
- Parcel must be in a single-family residential zone
- Parcel must be at least partially in an urbanized area/urban cluster

**Development standards:**
- Objective standards only (no subjective design review)
- Lot splits: Cannot exceed 60/40 split

**Restrictions:**
- Not in earthquake fault zones
- Not in special flood hazard areas
- Additional restrictions per state law (historic districts, conservation zones, etc.)

### SB 9 + ADU Compound Strategy

SB 9 lots can also have ADUs — compound density strategy:
- 2 primary units (via SB 9 lot split or two-unit development)
- Plus ADUs on each resulting lot
- Potentially 4+ units on what was originally a single-family lot
