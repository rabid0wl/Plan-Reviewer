## Manufactured Homes and Mobilehome Parks

### Can a Manufactured Home Be Used as an ADU?

**Yes.** By definition, an ADU includes manufactured homes. (Gov. Code, § 66313, subd. (a)(2); HSC, §§ 18007, 18008.)

A "manufactured home" is a structure constructed on or after June 15, 1976, that is:
- Transportable in one or more sections
- Eight body feet or more in width, or 40 body feet or more in length (in traveling mode), or 320+ square feet when erected on site
- Built on a permanent chassis
- Designed for use as a single-family dwelling with or without a foundation when connected to required utilities
- Includes plumbing, heating, air conditioning, and electrical systems

(HSC, § 18007, subd. (a).)

For more information on manufactured homes, contact HCD's Division of Codes and Standards at ContactMH-FBH@hcd.ca.gov.

### Are ADUs Permitted in Mobilehome Parks?

**No.** A lot within a mobilehome park or special occupancy park, as defined in Health and Safety Code sections 18210 and 18862.23, allows for **only one** manufactured home, mobilehome, or recreational vehicle. HSC § 18862.23 also allows one tent, camp car, camping cabin, or camping party on a lot within a special occupancy park.

ADUs **cannot** be added to lots within mobilehome parks or special occupancy parks.

### Are "Tiny Homes" Considered ADUs?

**Possibly.** State ADU Law does not specifically reference "tiny homes." "Tiny home" is an industry term that can mean different structures or vehicles. If the unit meets the definition of an ADU in Government Code section 66313, subdivision (a), it is subject to ADU Law.

For more information on tiny homes, see HCD Information Bulletin 2016-01. Contact HCD's Division of Codes and Standards at ContactMH-FBH@hcd.ca.gov.
