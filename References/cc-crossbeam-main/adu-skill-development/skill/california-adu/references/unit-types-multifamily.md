## Multifamily ADU Rules

### What Counts as Multifamily?

For ADU purposes, a structure with **two or more attached dwellings on a single lot** is considered a multifamily dwelling structure. **Multiple detached single-unit dwellings** on the same lot are **not** considered multifamily. (Gov. Code, § 66314.)

### Must Local Agencies Permit ADUs on Multifamily Lots?

Yes. A local agency must permit an attached, detached, or converted ADU on a lot zoned for single-family or multifamily residential use that includes an existing or proposed dwelling. (Gov. Code, § 66314, subds. (d)(2), (d)(3).)

### 66323 Multifamily ADU Categories

Under Gov. Code § 66323, multifamily lots qualify for two categories:

#### Converted ADUs — § 66323(a)(3)

- Created within portions of **existing multifamily structures not used as livable space** (e.g., storage rooms, boiler rooms, passageways, attics, basements, garages).
- Local agencies must allow **at least one ADU** within the existing structure.
- May allow **up to 25% of existing multifamily dwelling units**.
- Includes conversion of leasing offices and other non-livable spaces.

(Gov. Code, § 66323, subds. (a)(3)(A), (a)(3)(B).)

#### Detached ADUs — § 66323(a)(4)

- **Proposed multifamily dwelling**: Up to **2 detached ADUs**.
- **Existing multifamily dwelling**: Up to **8 detached ADUs**, not to exceed the number of existing units on the lot.
- Subject to **4-foot rear and side yard setbacks**.
- Height limits: **16, 18, or 20 feet** depending on conditions in Gov. Code § 66321, subd. (b)(4).
- Local agencies may not require setback modifications for existing multifamily dwellings with setbacks less than 4 feet. (Gov. Code, § 66323, subd. (a)(4)(B).)

### Combining Categories

Local agencies must allow categories (a)(3) and (a)(4) together on a multifamily lot. This means a multifamily lot can have:
- At least **1 converted ADU** (or up to 25% of existing units), AND
- Up to **2 detached ADUs** (proposed MF) or **8 detached ADUs** (existing MF, capped at existing unit count)

### No JADUs on Multifamily Lots

JADUs may **not** be constructed on multifamily sites. JADUs are only permitted on lots with a proposed or existing single-family dwelling in an area zoned for single-family residences. (Gov. Code, § 66333, subd. (a).)

### Can Detached ADUs Be Attached to Each Other?

Yes. Multifamily detached ADUs must be detached from the primary multifamily structure, but they **do not have to be detached from each other** or from other accessory structures on the lot. (Gov. Code, § 66323, subd. (a)(4)(A).)

### Leasing Office Conversions

A leasing office within an existing multifamily dwelling structure can be converted to at least one ADU — and up to 25% of existing units — provided the ADUs comply with building standards for dwellings. (Gov. Code, § 66323, subd. (a)(3)(A).)

A leasing office on a lot with an existing multifamily dwelling may also be converted into detached ADUs (up to 8, subject to the existing unit cap and standard setback/height limits). (Gov. Code, § 66323, subd. (a)(4)(A).)

An ADU can also be created from an accessory space (including a leasing office) that is attached to or located within the multifamily structure or accessory structure, or detached from the primary dwelling on the same lot, subject to applicable standards. (Gov. Code, § 66314, subd. (d)(3).)

### Objective Standards on Multifamily ADUs

Local agencies **may not** impose objective standards on ADUs in multifamily dwelling structures beyond what is specified in § 66323. The previous provision (Gov. Code, § 66323, subd. (g)) that allowed imposition of objective standards if a local agency had adopted an ADU ordinance by July 1, 2018, has been **removed**. (Changed by AB 130, effective June 30, 2025.)

### Accessibility Standards

For ADUs converted from existing space in multifamily dwellings, ADA standards may apply depending on the specific dwelling. Contact the Division of Codes and Standards at HCDBuildingStandards@hcd.ca.gov for guidance.
