## Housing Elements, RHNA, and Prohousing Designation

### Do ADUs and JADUs Count Toward a Local Agency's RHNA?

**Yes.** ADUs and JADUs may be utilized towards the RHNA and the Housing Element Annual Progress Report (APR). (Gov. Code, §§ 66330; 65583.1.)

To credit a unit toward the RHNA, HCD and the Department of Finance (DOF) utilize the **U.S. Census definition of a housing unit**. Generally, an ADU, a JADU with shared sanitation facilities, and any other unit meeting that definition and reported to DOF can be credited toward the RHNA based on the appropriate income level.

The housing element or APR must include a **reasonable methodology** to demonstrate the level of affordability. Local governments can track actual or anticipated affordability to assure ADUs and JADUs are counted towards the appropriate income category.

### What Analysis Is Required to Count ADUs Toward RHNA?

Local agencies must generally use a **three-part approach**:

1. **Development trends** — ADUs permitted in the prior planning period (may also consider more recent trends)
2. **Anticipated affordability** — Various methods to estimate affordability by income group (e.g., rent surveys, square footage assumptions, APR data)
3. **Resources and incentives** — Policies and programs to encourage ADUs (prototype plans, fee waivers, expedited procedures, affordability monitoring)

### Are ADUs Required to Be Addressed in the Housing Element?

**Yes.** The housing element must include:

- A description of **zoning available** to permit ADUs, including development standards
- An analysis of **potential constraints** on ADU development
- Programs to **address identified constraints**
- A plan that **incentivizes and promotes** ADUs offering affordable rents for very low-, low-, or moderate-income households

HCD is required to develop a list of state grants and financial incentives in connection with the planning, construction, and operation of affordable ADUs. (Gov. Code, § 65583; HSC, § 50504.5.)

### Prohousing Designation Program

**Can ADUs impact Prohousing Designation status?**

**Yes.** To qualify for a Prohousing Designation, a local agency must be in **compliance with all applicable state housing laws**, including State ADU Law. (Gov. Code, § 65585, subd. (j).)

Key points:
- An approved housing element and associated ADU programs must be enacted and in compliance
- ADUs and JADUs are **specifically identified** as designation criteria (CCR Title 25, § 6606)
- An ADU ordinance or program that **promotes development beyond** State ADU Law's minimum requirements may score **additional points**
- Local agencies **in violation** of State ADU Law will be **ineligible** for a Prohousing Designation
- Agencies that promote additional ADU development can score extra points and receive the benefits that designation provides

(CCR Title 25, §§ 6600-6608.)
