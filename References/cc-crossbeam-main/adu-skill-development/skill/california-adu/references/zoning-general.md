## General Zoning Rules

### Are ADUs Allowed Jurisdiction-Wide?

No. Local agencies may designate by ordinance where ADUs are permitted within zones that allow residential use. However, limitations on where ADUs are allowed may only be based on:

1. **Adequacy of water and sewer services**, and
2. **Impacts on traffic flow and public safety**

(Gov. Code, § 66314, subd. (a).)

Local governments may not preclude the creation of ADUs altogether. Any limitation must be accompanied by **detailed findings of fact** explaining why the restriction is required and consistent with the factors above. Traffic impact analysis should consider lower car ownership rates for ADUs.

If a lot with a residence has been **rezoned** to a non-residential use, that lot is no longer eligible for an ADU. (Gov. Code, §§ 66314; 66323, subd. (a).)

Local governments may develop **alternative procedures, standards, or special conditions** with mitigations for allowing ADUs in areas with potential health and safety concerns.

### ADUs and Lot Density

**Can an ADU application be denied due to lot density?**

No. An ADU ordinance shall provide that ADUs do not exceed the allowable density on the lot. ADUs that conform to Government Code section 66314 **shall not be considered to exceed the allowable density** for the lot. (Gov. Code, §§ 66314, subd. (c); 66319.)

### State Density Bonus Law (SDBL) Interaction

**Can ADUs qualify a project for a density bonus?**

Yes — for meeting the five-unit minimum. A project qualifies under the SDBL when its "total units" (before a density bonus) meet or exceed five units. Although the SDBL does not mention ADUs, it does not expressly exclude them. ADUs counted within the total units may satisfy the five-unit minimum. (Gov. Code, § 65915, subd. (o)(8).)

**Can ADUs be used to calculate the density bonus itself?**

No. The density bonus is calculated based on the site's **maximum allowable residential density**, which does not include ADUs. Maximum allowable residential density is the greatest number of units allowed under the zoning ordinance, specific plan, or land use element of the general plan. (Gov. Code, § 65915, subds. (f), (o)(6).)

**Example:** A site where zoning allows 2 units and the general plan allows 3 has a base density of 3 — even if adding 2 ADUs brings total units to 5. The density bonus is calculated on a base density of 3, not 5.

### Design and Development Standards

**Can a local government apply design and development standards?**

Yes, with a compliant ADU ordinance. A local government may apply **objective** standards including parking, height, setback, landscape, architectural review, maximum size, and standards that prevent adverse impacts on properties listed in the California Register of Historical Resources. Standards must be objective to allow ministerial review. (Gov. Code, §§ 66314, subd. (b)(1); 66316.)

**66323 Units** are not subject to design and development standards except those specified in section 66323 itself. (Gov. Code, § 66323, subds. (a), (b).)

### ADUs in Historic Districts

ADUs are allowed within a historic district and on lots where the primary residence is subject to historic preservation. A local agency may impose standards that prevent adverse impacts on any real property listed in the California Register of Historical Resources, but these must be **objective** and must not unreasonably restrict ADU creation. (Gov. Code, §§ 66314, subd. (b)(1); 66311.)

### Garage Demolition

When a garage is demolished in conjunction with ADU permitting, the local agency must review and issue the demolition permit and ADU application **at the same time**. The applicant is not required to provide written notice or post a placard for the demolition unless the property is in an architecturally and historically significant historic district. (Gov. Code, § 66314, subds. (e), (f).)
