## Hazard Zones — Fire, Coastal, and Environmental Constraints

### Fire Hazard Severity Zones

**Can local agencies restrict ADUs based on Fire Hazard Severity Zones?**

Some agencies have used the High (HFHSZ) and Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zone (VHFHSZ) maps from CAL FIRE to restrict or prohibit ADUs. However, according to CAL FIRE, these maps are intended to govern **building materials** and define **zones of defensibility** around structures — they are **not intended to restrict housing development**.

The presence of a High Fire Hazard Severity Zone is **not a conclusive rationale** to restrict ADUs. Any restriction based on public safety must be supported with **findings detailing the specific impact of ADUs on public safety**. (Gov. Code, § 66314, subd. (a).)

**State preemption note:** Local agencies may develop alternative procedures, standards, or special conditions with mitigations for allowing ADUs in areas with potential health and safety concerns — but they cannot impose blanket prohibitions based solely on fire hazard zone maps.

### California Coastal Zone

**Do state ADU laws apply in the Coastal Zone?**

Yes. ADU laws apply to jurisdictions in the California Coastal Zone, but they **do not alter or lessen** the effect or application of Coastal Act resource protection policies. (Gov. Code, § 66329.)

**60-Day Approval Deadline:** In the coastal zone, a local government or the California Coastal Commission must **approve or deny** a coastal development permit application for an ADU **within 60 days** of receiving a completed application. (Changed by AB 462, effective October 10, 2025.) (Gov. Code, § 66329, subd. (a).)

Coastal localities should seek to **harmonize** the goals of protecting coastal resources and addressing housing needs. Where appropriate, localities should amend Local Coastal Programs for California Coastal Commission review to comply with both the California Coastal Act and State ADU Laws.

**Additional setback requirements** may be required in the Coastal Zone if required by a Local Coastal Program. (Gov. Code, § 66329.)

For more information, see the California Coastal Commission 2020 Memo and contact the local Coastal Commission district office.

### Environmental Hazards Generally

Local agencies may only restrict where ADUs are permitted based on:
- Adequacy of water and sewer services
- Impacts on traffic flow and public safety

(Gov. Code, § 66314, subd. (a).)

Any restriction must be accompanied by **detailed findings of fact** and may not preclude ADUs altogether. Local governments may create alternative procedures with mitigations for areas with health and safety concerns.

- Gov. Code § 66329 — ADU law applies in Coastal Zone but does not lessen Coastal Act protections
