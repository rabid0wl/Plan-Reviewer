## Design Standards — Objective vs. Subjective

### Ministerial Review Requires Objective Standards

ADUs must be considered, approved or denied, and permitted **ministerially** — without discretionary review or a hearing. Development standards must be **objective** to allow ministerial review. (Gov. Code, §§ 66317, subd. (a); 66314, subd. (b)(1).)

### What Are Objective Standards?

Standards that involve **no personal or subjective judgment** by a public official and are uniformly verifiable by reference to an **external and uniform benchmark or criterion** available and knowable by both the applicant and the public official prior to application submission. (Gov. Code, § 66313, subd. (i).)

**Examples of objective standards:**
- Numeric and fixed standards (heights, setbacks)
- Specified colors or materials
- Specific architectural features (e.g., "roof pitch must match primary dwelling")

### What Are Subjective Standards?

Subjective standards require **independent judgment** and are open to multiple interpretations. These **may not be imposed** on ADU development. (Gov. Code, § 66313, subd. (i).)

**Examples of prohibited subjective standards:**
- "Privacy"
- "Compatibility with neighboring properties"
- "Promoting design harmony and balance"
- "Must maintain similar architecture style"
- Requiring "high quality materials"

### What Standards Can Be Imposed?

With a compliant ADU ordinance, a local agency may apply objective development and design standards including, but not limited to: parking, height, setback, landscape, architectural review, maximum size, and standards that prevent adverse impacts on California Register of Historical Resources properties. (Gov. Code, §§ 66314, subd. (b)(1); 66316.)

All standards must be **objective** to allow ministerial review and must not **unreasonably restrict** ADU creation. (Gov. Code, § 66311.)

### 66323 Units — Limited Standards

A local agency **may not** impose development or design standards on 66323 Units that are not specifically listed in Gov. Code § 66323. This includes parking, height, setbacks, lot size, open space, FAR, and other zoning provisions. (Gov. Code, § 66323, subds. (a), (b).)

### Bedroom Restrictions

**Can a bedroom limit be imposed?** No. A bedroom limit could be construed as discriminatory toward protected classes such as familial status and would constrain ADU development. (Gov. Code, § 65008.)

**Can an ADU have no bedrooms?** Yes. Requiring bedrooms could similarly be discriminatory and could unreasonably restrict ADU creation. Building code standards for minimum bedroom size still apply. (Gov. Code, §§ 65008, 66311.)

### Historic Districts

ADUs are allowed within historic districts and on lots where the primary residence is subject to historic preservation. A local agency may impose standards that **prevent adverse impacts** on properties listed in the California Register of Historical Resources. (Gov. Code, § 66314, subd. (b)(1).)

As with non-historic resources, standards must be objective and must not unreasonably restrict ADU creation. (Gov. Code, § 66311.)

### Garage Demolition in Historic Districts

A local or permitting agency must review and issue the demolition permit and ADU application **at the same time**. Written notice or placard posting for garage demolition is not required **unless** the property is in an architecturally and historically significant historic district. (Gov. Code, § 66314, subds. (e), (f).)
