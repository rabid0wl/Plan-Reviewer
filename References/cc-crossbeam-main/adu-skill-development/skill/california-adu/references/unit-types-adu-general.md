## ADU Definition and Three Physical Types

### What Is an ADU?

An ADU is accessory to a primary residence and has **complete independent living facilities** for one or more persons. ADUs are either "detached from," "attached to," or located within the proposed or existing primary dwelling. This includes attached garages, storage areas or similar spaces, and accessory structures. The ADU can also be detached from the proposed or existing primary dwelling, including detached garages, provided it is located on the same lot. (Gov. Code, §§ 66313, subd. (a); 66314, subd. (d)(3).)

Note: Certain federal financing programs may define ADUs differently — see `permit-funding.md`.

### Three Physical Construction Types

#### 1. Attached ADUs

An attached ADU is a **newly created dwelling structure that structurally abuts and connects to** an existing or proposed primary dwelling or accessory structure. (Gov. Code, § 66314, subd. (d)(3).)

- Can be constructed on top of or below the primary dwelling.
- Extends beyond the building plane of the existing or proposed primary dwelling.
- **Shall not exceed 50% of the existing primary dwelling's floor area**. (Gov. Code, § 66314, subd. (d)(4).)

Examples:
- An ADU addition to a duplex
- An ADU built on top of an attached garage
- An ADU built as a new second story of a single-family dwelling
- An ADU built in a newly constructed basement

#### 2. Converted ADUs

Converted ADUs are dwelling units **created from existing space** within proposed or existing primary dwellings or existing accessory structures. (Gov. Code, § 66323, subds. (a)(1), (a)(3)(A).)

- **Single-family**: Created from proposed or existing space of the single-family residence or existing space of an accessory structure.
- **Multifamily**: Created from portions of multifamily dwelling structures not used as livable space (e.g., storage rooms, passageways, basements, garages).

**Standards that do NOT apply to conversions**: Objective standards related to height, lot coverage, landscape, design, development, and architectural standards in the local ADU ordinance do not apply. Since conversions are within existing structures, height is limited to the original structure dimensions. Conversions are not subject to setback requirements because they are within existing structures or built to the same dimensions. (Gov. Code, § 66323, subds. (a)(1), (a)(3)(A).)

**Standards that DO apply**: All applicable building, health and safety, and fire standards for dwellings.

**Can accessory structures be converted?** Yes. Detached garages, sheds, and other existing detached accessory structures may be converted into ADUs. (Gov. Code, §§ 66314, subd. (d)(3); 66323, subds. (a)(1), (a)(3)(A).)

#### 3. Detached ADUs

Detached ADUs are **newly constructed dwelling units** on a lot with an existing or proposed single-family or multifamily dwelling structure, but **detached from the primary dwelling**. (Gov. Code, §§ 66314, subd. (d)(3); 66323, subds. (a)(1), (a)(2), (a)(4)(A).)

- On multifamily lots, detached ADUs must be detached from the primary multifamily structure but do not have to be detached from each other or other accessory structures on the lot. (Gov. Code, § 66323, subd. (a)(4)(A).)

### Bedrooms

**Can a limit on bedrooms be imposed?** No. A bedroom limit could be construed as discriminatory toward protected classes such as familial status and would constrain ADU development. (Gov. Code, § 65008.) Building code standards for minimum bedroom size still apply.

**Can an ADU have no bedrooms?** Yes. A bedroom requirement could similarly be construed as discriminatory and could unreasonably restrict homeowners' ability to create ADUs. (Gov. Code, §§ 65008, 66311.) Building code standards for minimum bedroom size still apply.
