## Local ADU Ordinances and HCD Enforcement

### Should Local Ordinances Encourage ADU Development?

**Yes.** The Legislature declared that ADUs are an essential component of California's housing supply and a valuable form of housing that meets the needs of family members, students, the elderly, in-home health care providers, people with disabilities, and others. (Gov. Code, § 66310.)

Local governments adopting ADU ordinances should carefully weigh the adoption of zoning, development standards, and other provisions for impacts on the development of ADUs. Local governments **may elect to go beyond** the statutory minimum to further ADU creation. (Gov. Code, § 66325, subd. (b).)

### Do Local Agencies Have to Adopt an ADU Ordinance?

**No.** Local agencies may choose not to adopt an ADU ordinance. If no ordinance is adopted, any proposed ADU development is subject **only to state standards**. (Gov. Code, §§ 66315, 66316.)

A local agency that does adopt an ADU ordinance may impose **objective** development and design standards in compliance with Government Code section 66314.

### Is a Local Agency Required to Send an ADU Ordinance to HCD?

**Yes.** A local government must submit a copy of the adopted ordinance to HCD **within 60 days** after adoption. HCD may review and submit written findings to the local agency as to whether the ordinance complies with State ADU Law. (Gov. Code, § 66326, subd. (a).)

### HCD Enforcement Authority

If HCD finds a local ADU ordinance does not comply with State ADU Law:
1. The local agency must **respond within 30 days**
2. The agency must either **amend its ordinance** per HCD's findings or adopt the ordinance with findings explaining why it complies
3. If the agency does not amend or explain, HCD shall notify the agency and **may notify the Attorney General** that the agency is in violation
4. While an ordinance is non-compliant, the local agency shall **apply state standards** for ADU approval until a compliant ordinance is adopted

(Gov. Code, § 66326, subds. (b), (c)(1).)

**Null and Void Consequence:** If a local agency fails to submit an adopted ADU ordinance to HCD within the 60-day timeline or fails to respond to HCD's findings within the 30-day timeline, the ordinance is **null and void** and the agency must apply State ADU Law only when permitting ADUs. (Changed by SB 9 (2025), effective January 1, 2026.) (Gov. Code, § 66326, subd. (d).)

**JADU Ordinances:** The same null-and-void rule applies to JADU ordinances. If a local agency fails to submit an adopted JADU ordinance to HCD within 60 days or fails to respond to HCD's findings within 30 days, the JADU ordinance is null and void and the agency must apply State ADU Law only when processing JADU applications. (Changed by SB 543, effective January 1, 2026.) (Gov. Code, § 66333.5.)

HCD may also review, adopt, amend, or repeal **guidelines** to implement uniform standards or criteria that supplement or clarify State ADU Law. HCD's authority now explicitly extends to **JADUs** as well as ADUs. (Changed by SB 543, effective January 1, 2026.) (Gov. Code, §§ 66311; 66327.)

### ADU Bonus Programs

One common strategy used by local agencies is to adopt ADU bonus programs. A successful bonus program should meet these criteria:

1. **Completely optional** — No requirement or consequence for not participating
2. **Additive only** — Benefits are in addition to State ADU Law provisions, not in lieu of them; all state-mandated requirements are granted unconditionally
3. **Removes physical constraints** — Such as limitations on the number of allowable units, ADU size, height, setback requirements, or waiver of design/development criteria

### Charter Cities and Counties

**Yes**, State ADU Law applies to charter cities and counties. A "local agency" is defined as a city, county, or city and county, whether **general law or chartered**. (Gov. Code, §§ 66312; 66313, subd. (g).)

### Tahoe Regional Planning Agency (TRPA)

TRPA was formed through a bistate compact between California and Nevada, which elevates its authority above state laws. To the extent TRPA standards conflict with State ADU Law, **TRPA law preempts** State ADU Law. For more information: https://www.trpa.gov/adus/.
