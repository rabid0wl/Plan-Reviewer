## Setback Rules

### Side and Rear Setbacks

A setback of **no more than 4 feet** from the side and rear lot lines may be required for an attached or detached ADU. (Gov. Code, § 66314, subd. (d)(7).)

This means a local agency can require up to 4-foot side and rear setbacks, but **not more**.

### No Setback for Existing Structures

**No setback** is required for:
- An ADU or JADU created **within an existing living area or accessory structure**.
- An ADU created in a **new structure in the same location and to the same dimensions** as an existing structure.

(Gov. Code, § 66314, subd. (d)(7).)

### Front Setbacks

A local agency **may** apply front yard setbacks, but front yard setbacks **cannot preclude** an ADU of at least **800 sq ft** from being built on the property — even if that ADU would exist partially or wholly within the front setback. (Gov. Code, § 66321, subd. (b)(3).)

### Can a Local Agency Require an Alternate Location?

Maybe. Local agencies may set objective standards including front setbacks. However, a permitting agency **may not** require an ADU of up to 800 sq ft to be built in an alternative location based on discretionary (non-objective) standards. Requiring an alternative site using objective standards must not be overly burdensome such that it unreasonably restricts ADU creation. (Gov. Code, §§ 66321, subd. (b)(3); 66311.)

### Distance Between Structures

State ADU Law does not address distance between an ADU and other structures on a lot. A local agency may impose objective development standards, but they must not unreasonably restrict ADU creation unless they are a requirement of a building or fire code. (Gov. Code, §§ 66311; 66314, subd. (d)(8).)

### Coastal Zone Setbacks

Additional setback requirements may apply in the Coastal Zone if required by a local Coastal Program. (Gov. Code, § 66329.)

### 66323 Units

66323 detached ADUs (§ 66323(a)(2) and (a)(4)) are subject to **4-foot side and rear setbacks**. Converted 66323 ADUs (§ 66323(a)(1) and (a)(3)) are **not subject** to the 4-foot setback requirement because they are within existing structures. (Gov. Code, § 66323, subds. (a)(1), (a)(2), (a)(4).)

A local agency may not require setback modifications for an existing multifamily dwelling with setbacks less than 4 feet. (Gov. Code, § 66323, subd. (a)(4)(B).)
