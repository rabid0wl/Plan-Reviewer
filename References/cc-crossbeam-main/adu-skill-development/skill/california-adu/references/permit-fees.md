## Fees — Impact Fees, Proportionality, School Fees, and Utility Connections

### What Are Impact Fees?

Impact fees are any monetary exaction other than a tax or special assessment charged by a local agency in connection with ADU approval for the purpose of defraying all or a portion of the cost of public facilities relating to the ADU. Fees must be determined in accordance with the **Mitigation Fee Act**. (Gov. Code, §§ 66324, subd. (a); 66000.)

### ADUs Under 750 Square Feet of Interior Livable Space — Exempt

Impact fees are **prohibited** for an ADU that has **750 square feet of interior livable space or less**. JADUs with **500 square feet of interior livable space or less** are also exempt from impact fees. (Changed by SB 543, effective January 1, 2026.) (Gov. Code, § 66311.5, subds. (a)-(c).)

**Important:** Exterior expansions count toward the threshold. A 700 sq ft interior conversion with a 150 sq ft exterior expansion for ingress/egress counts as 850 sq ft and triggers proportionate fees.

### ADUs Over 750 Square Feet of Interior Livable Space — Proportional Fees

Impact fees for ADUs with **more than 750 sq ft of interior livable space** must be charged **proportionately in relation to the square footage of the primary dwelling unit**. (Changed by SB 543, effective January 1, 2026.) (Gov. Code, § 66311.5, subd. (d).)

> **Proportionality example:** A 2,000 sq ft primary dwelling with a proposed 1,000 sq ft ADU = 50% of the impact fee that would be charged for a new primary dwelling on the same site.

In this context, impact fees also include **Quimby fees** (park dedication fees). (Gov. Code, §§ 66324, subd. (c)(2); 66477.)

### Assessable Space Exemption

An ADU or JADU that contains **less than 500 square feet of interior livable space** does **not increase assessable space**. This is important for the calculation and imposition of school fees. (Changed by SB 543, effective January 1, 2026.) (Gov. Code, § 66311, subd. (d).)

### School District Fees

School districts are authorized (but not required) to levy impact fees on ADUs **larger than 500 square feet** pursuant to Education Code § 17620 and the Mitigation Fee Act (Gov. Code, § 66000).

- ADUs or JADUs with **less than 500 sq ft of interior livable space** do not increase assessable space and are **not subject** to school impact fees. (Changed by SB 543, effective January 1, 2026.)
- Local agencies should **not withhold** an ADU or JADU permit due to school fees.
- Local agencies are encouraged to coordinate with school districts to ensure appropriate nexus studies are conducted.

### Utility Connection and Capacity Fees

**Converted ADUs and JADUs** (constructed from existing space) shall **not** be considered a new residential use for purposes of calculating connection fees or capacity charges for utilities, including water and sewer services. (Gov. Code, § 66324, subd. (b).)

**Exception:** This does not apply to ADUs constructed concurrently with a new single-family dwelling. (Gov. Code, § 66324, subd. (d).)

**All ADUs:** Connection fees or capacity charges must be **proportionate** to the burden of the proposed ADU, based on its square footage or plumbing fixtures as compared to the primary dwelling. (Gov. Code, § 66324, subd. (e).)

### Fee Summary Table

| ADU Size (interior livable space) | Impact Fees | School Fees | Utility Connection |
|-----------------------------------|------------|-------------|-------------------|
| JADU ≤ 500 sq ft | **Exempt** (§ 66311.5) | Exempt — no assessable space increase | Proportionate (converted = exempt*) |
| ADU < 500 sq ft | **Exempt** (§ 66311.5) | Exempt — no assessable space increase | Proportionate (converted = exempt*) |
| ADU 500–750 sq ft | **Exempt** (§ 66311.5) | Authorized if > 500 sq ft | Proportionate (converted = exempt*) |
| ADU > 750 sq ft | **Proportionate** to primary dwelling (§ 66311.5) | Authorized if > 500 sq ft | Proportionate (converted = exempt*) |

*Except when constructed concurrently with a new single-family dwelling.

### Deed Restrictions and Fees

A local agency **cannot impose a deed restriction** on an ADU. Gov. Code § 66315 establishes that no additional standards beyond those in § 66314 shall be imposed. A deed restriction is not a design or development standard. (Gov. Code, § 66315.)

**JADUs** are different — a local agency **may require** recordation of a deed restriction that includes a prohibition on separate sale and a restriction on size/attributes conforming with state law. (Gov. Code, § 66333, subds. (c)(1), (c)(2).)
