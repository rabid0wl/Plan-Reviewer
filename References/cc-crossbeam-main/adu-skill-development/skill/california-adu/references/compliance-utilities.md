## Utility Connections and CPUC Complaints

### Can a Local Agency, Special District, or Water Corporation Require a New or Separate Connection?

**It depends on the ADU type.**

**66323(a)(1) converted ADUs** — ADUs and JADUs created from the existing space of a primary dwelling or accessory structure pursuant to Gov. Code § 66323, subd. (a)(1), **cannot** be required to install a new or separate utility connection, **unless** the ADU is constructed concurrently with a new single-family dwelling. (Gov. Code, § 66324, subd. (d).)

**All other ADUs** — For ADUs not created under § 66323(a)(1), a new or separate connection directly from the utility to the ADU **may be required**. (Gov. Code, § 66324, subd. (e).)

### Electrical and Gas Utilities

HCD does not have authority over issues related to gas and electrical services.

If an applicant believes a local utility provider is not complying with connection requirements, fee schedules, or other issues that impact the creation or service of an ADU, the applicant can file a complaint with the appropriate agency:

**Privately owned public utilities** (e.g., PG&E):
- Contact the **California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC)**
- Online complaint form available at CPUC's website
- Phone: 1-800-649-7570
- Mail: California Public Utilities Commission, 505 Van Ness Avenue, San Francisco, CA 94102-3298

**Publicly owned utilities** (e.g., SMUD):
- Contact the utility directly and follow their complaint process
