## Size Requirements and Restrictions

### Minimum and Maximum Unit Sizes

A local agency may establish minimum and maximum unit size requirements by ordinance, subject to state-mandated floors:

| ADU Type | Minimum Local Max Must Allow | Code Section |
|---|---|---|
| Any ADU (1 bedroom or fewer) | At least **850 sq ft of interior living space** | § 66321(b)(2)(A) |
| Any ADU (2+ bedrooms) | At least **1,000 sq ft of interior living space** | § 66321(b)(2)(B) |
| Detached new-construction (no local ordinance) | Up to **1,200 sq ft of interior living space** | § 66314(d)(4) |
| Attached ADU (no local ordinance) | Up to **50% of existing primary dwelling** floor area (at least 800 sq ft) | §§ 66314(d)(5); 66321(a)(3) |
| 66323(a)(2) detached (state-mandated) | **800 sq ft** max | § 66323(a)(2) |
| Efficiency unit (minimum) | As small as **150 sq ft** | HSC § 17958.1 |

(Changed by SB 543, effective January 1, 2026: size limitations for ADUs are now based on **interior living space**.)

A local agency **must not** establish a minimum that prohibits an efficiency unit (150 sq ft). (Health & Safety Code, § 17958.1.)

### Can Local Agencies Allow Larger ADUs?

Yes. Maximum unit sizes can exceed 1,200 sq ft through adoption of a less restrictive local ADU ordinance. State law does not limit the authority of local agencies to adopt less restrictive requirements. (Gov. Code, § 66325, subd. (b).)

### Attached ADU Percentage Limit

Local agencies may use a percentage of the existing primary dwelling (e.g., 50%) as a maximum for attached ADUs, but only if it does not restrict the ADU to less than 850 sq ft (or 1,000 sq ft for 2+ bedrooms). (Gov. Code, §§ 66314, subd. (d)(4); 66321, subd. (b)(2).)

### Converted ADUs — No Size Limits

Conversion of an existing accessory structure or portion of the existing primary residence to an ADU is **not subject to unit size requirements**. (Gov. Code, § 66323, subd. (a)(1).)

### Floor Area Calculation

The California Building Code defines "Floor Area, Gross" as the floor area within the inside perimeter of the exterior walls, exclusive of vent shafts and courts. If a local agency has adopted specific amendments to this definition in its local building standards, those altered definitions apply. (Gov. Code, § 66314, subd. (d)(8).)

### Lot Coverage and Floor Area Ratio (FAR)

Lot coverage and FAR requirements **cannot preclude** an ADU of at least **800 sq ft of interior living space** with 4-foot rear and side setbacks. While FAR and lot coverage can apply to other ADUs, they must not unreasonably restrict ADU creation. (Changed by SB 543, effective January 1, 2026.) (Gov. Code, §§ 66321, subd. (b)(3); 66311.)

66323 Units are **not subject** to local FAR or lot coverage requirements. (Gov. Code, § 66323, subds. (a), (b).)

### Minimum Lot Size

Local agencies **may not** impose minimum lot size requirements for ADUs. (Gov. Code, § 66314, subd. (b)(1).)

### Open Space and Landscaping

Open space requirements **may not** deny an ADU of at least 800 sq ft with 4-foot rear and side setbacks. 66323 Units are not subject to local open space or landscaping requirements. (Gov. Code, §§ 66321, subd. (b)(3); 66323, subd. (b).)
