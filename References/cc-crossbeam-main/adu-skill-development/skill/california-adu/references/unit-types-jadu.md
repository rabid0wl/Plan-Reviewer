## Junior Accessory Dwelling Units (JADUs)

### What Is a JADU?

A JADU is a unit that is **no more than 500 square feet of interior livable space** in size and **contained entirely within a single-family residence**. (Changed by SB 543, effective January 1, 2026.) A JADU may include separate sanitation facilities or may share sanitation facilities with the existing structure. (Gov. Code, §§ 66313, subd. (d); 66333.)

### Key Rules

#### One Per Lot
Only **one JADU** may be created per lot zoned for single-family residences with an existing or proposed single-family residence. (Gov. Code, § 66333, subd. (a).) If there are multiple detached single-family residential units on one lot, there can only be one JADU.

#### Must Be Within Single-Family Residence
The JADU must be created **within the walls of the proposed or existing single-family residence**, including attached garages. (Gov. Code, § 66333, subd. (d).)

- **Not allowed in detached accessory structures** (detached garages, sheds, etc.). (Gov. Code, § 66333, subd. (d).)
- **Not allowed in multifamily dwellings.** JADUs may only be on a site with a proposed or existing single-family dwelling in an area zoned for single-family residences. (Gov. Code, § 66333, subd. (a).)

#### Half-Plexes
A JADU is permitted in a half-plex (two primary dwelling units on separate lots sharing a dividing wall). One JADU is permitted in each half-plex in areas zoned for single-family use. If two units are attached on a single lot (a duplex), the dwelling is considered multifamily and does not qualify for a JADU. (Gov. Code, § 66333, subd. (a).)

#### Interior Connection
JADUs must be within the walls of the primary dwelling but are **not required to have an interior connection** to the primary dwelling. However, if the JADU does not include a separate bathroom, it **must include an interior entrance** to the main living area. (Gov. Code, § 66333, subd. (e)(2).)

#### No Expansion
JADUs may **not expand beyond the existing dimensions** of the single-family dwelling. (The 150 sq ft expansion allowance applies only to ADUs converted from accessory structures under § 66323(a)(1)(A), not to JADUs.)

### Owner-Occupancy

Owner-occupancy depends on whether the JADU shares sanitation facilities with the primary structure. (Changed by AB 1154, effective January 1, 2026.)

- **Shared sanitation**: If the JADU shares sanitation facilities with the primary structure, the owner must reside in either the remaining portion of the primary residence or in the newly created JADU.
- **Separate sanitation**: If the JADU has its own separate sanitation facilities, owner-occupancy is **not required**.
- Owner-occupancy is also **not required** when the owner is another governmental agency, land trust, or housing organization.

(Gov. Code, § 66333, subd. (b).)

### Short-Term Rental Prohibition

JADUs **cannot be used as short-term rentals**. If a JADU is rented, it must be rented for a term **longer than 30 days**. (Changed by AB 1154, effective January 1, 2026.) (Gov. Code, § 66333, subd. (g).)

### Efficiency Kitchen

A JADU must have an **efficiency kitchen** — a cooking facility with:
- Appliances
- A food preparation counter
- Storage cabinets of reasonable size in relation to the JADU size

(Gov. Code, § 66333, subds. (f)(1), (f)(2).)

A local agency **cannot be more restrictive** than this definition. Requirements for specific counter/cabinet sizes, electrical or gas connections, or appliance types are not authorized by state JADU law.

### Parking

Local agencies **may not require parking** as a condition of permitting a JADU, even when the JADU is converted from an attached garage. (Gov. Code, § 66334, subd. (a).)

### Deed Restrictions

A local agency that adopts a JADU ordinance **must require recordation of a deed restriction** that includes only:
1. A prohibition on the sale of the JADU separate from the single-family residence.
2. A restriction on size and attributes conforming to state law.

(Gov. Code, § 66333, subds. (c)(1), (c)(2).)

### Fire Sprinklers

Fire sprinklers are **not required for a JADU** if the primary residence does not have fire sprinklers. The addition of a JADU **cannot trigger** the requirement for fire sprinklers. (Changed by SB 543, effective January 1, 2026.) (Gov. Code, § 66323, subd. (d).)

### JADU Ordinance Submission to HCD

If a local agency fails to submit an adopted JADU ordinance to HCD within the 60-day timeline or fails to respond to HCD's findings within 30 days, the ordinance is **null and void** and the agency must apply State ADU Law only when processing JADU applications. (Changed by SB 543, effective January 1, 2026.) (Gov. Code, § 66333.5.)

### Combination with ADUs

A JADU can be combined with a 66323 ADU on a single-family lot. Under § 66323(a)(1), a single-family lot may have one converted ADU + one JADU + one detached new-construction ADU — all three together.
