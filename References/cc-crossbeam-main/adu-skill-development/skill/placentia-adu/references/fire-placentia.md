## Fire Safety — Placentia

### Fire Service Provider: Placentia Fire and Life Safety Department

Placentia operates its **own municipal fire department** — this is unusual for Orange County, where most cities contract with OCFA.

**History:**
- 1975: Original fire department disbanded; OCFA took over fire services
- June 2019: City Council voted to form own department
- July 1, 2020: Placentia Fire and Life Safety Department began operations
- Contracted with Lynch EMS for 911/ALS paramedic services

**Performance since transition:**
- 40% more daily calls handled
- Response times over 3 minutes faster than under OCFA
- Mutual aid dependency reduced by 85%

### Fire Code (Title 18, Chapter 18.04)

| Standard | Detail |
|----------|--------|
| Code adopted | California Fire Code (CFC) **2022 Edition** |
| Base code | 2021 International Fire Code |
| Local amendments | Yes — Section 18.04.050 (attachment) |

**Key local amendments:**
- Fire department access and water requirements per city guideline
- Restrictions on storage of extremely hazardous substances in residential zones
- Hazardous Materials Inventory Statement (HMIS) requirements

### ADU Sprinkler Rules

Fire sprinklers are **NOT required** for an ADU if sprinklers are not required for the primary residence:
- Per Placentia Municipal Code § 23.73.060
- Per state law (Gov. Code § 65852.2)
- Building an ADU does NOT trigger a sprinkler requirement in the existing primary dwelling

### Fire Hazard Severity Zones (FHSZ)

- **March 2025:** CAL FIRE issued 2025 recommended LRA FHSZ maps; Placentia was **newly added**
- **June 17, 2025:** City Council adopted **Ordinance O-2025-04** designating Fire Hazard Severity Zones
- Local agency cannot decrease the recommended FHSZ level; may only maintain or increase
- **Eastern hills near Carbon Canyon** may have FHSZ designations — most of the city (urbanized flatland) is likely NOT in Very High FHSZ

**Impact on ADUs:**
- Properties in FHSZ may face additional requirements:
  - Defensible space
  - Chapter 7A CBC building material standards (fire-resistant roofing, eaves, vents, decking)
  - Enhanced access requirements
- Verify specific parcel FHSZ status via CAL FIRE viewer
