## Fees — Placentia

### ADU Impact Fee Rules (§ 23.73.070)

| ADU Size | Impact Fees |
|----------|------------|
| **Under 750 sq ft** | **EXEMPT** from all development impact fees |
| **750+ sq ft (SF lot)** | (Full SF DIF) × (ADU sq ft / Primary dwelling sq ft) |
| **750+ sq ft (MF lot)** | (Full MF DIF) × (ADU sq ft / Average MF unit sq ft) |
| **JADU within existing SFR** | **EXEMPT** from citywide DIFs |

"Impact fee" has the same meaning as Government Code § 65852.2(f).
