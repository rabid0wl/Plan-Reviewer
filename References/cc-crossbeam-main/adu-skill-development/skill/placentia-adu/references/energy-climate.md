## Energy Code — Placentia (Climate Zone 8)

### Climate Zone

**Placentia is in California Climate Zone 8** for Title 24 energy code purposes.

Zone 8 covers much of coastal/near-coastal Southern California including: Irvine, Tustin, Orange, Placentia, Fullerton, Anaheim, Norwalk, Downey, Cypress, Brea, and surrounding cities.

### Title 24 Energy Code

Plans submitted after January 1, 2026 must comply with the **2025 Energy Code** (Title 24 Part 6).

**Energy Code Fact Sheet (from city):** https://www.placentia.org/DocumentCenter/View/14797/

### Key Prescriptive Requirements for Climate Zone 8 ADUs

#### Roof/Ceiling (Vented Attic)
- U-factor: at most 0.025 (R-38+ insulation for wood-framed)
- If ducts in unconditioned attic: roof deck U-factor at most 0.184 (R-5 above or below deck)

#### Walls (Above Grade, Framed)
- Max U-factor: 0.051
- **Option A:** 2x6 @ 16" OC with R-19 cavity + R-5 continuous rigid
- **Option B:** 2x4 @ 16" OC with R-15 cavity + R-8 continuous rigid

#### ADU as Addition (relaxed requirements)
- If treated as an "addition" rather than new construction, some prescriptive requirements are relaxed
- Existing 2x6 walls may use **R-21 cavity insulation only** (no continuous insulation required)
- Continuous insulation not required on existing walls being retained

### Solar PV Requirements

- **New detached ADUs (non-manufactured):** Solar PV **required** per California Energy Code
- Conversion ADUs: Solar NOT required
- JADUs: Solar NOT required
- Manufactured/prefab ADUs: May have different requirements

Solar PV must be shown on plans — either on the primary home or as a deferred submittal note for a new PV system on the proposed detached ADU.

### Plan Check Energy Requirements

- **2 sets** of Title 24 energy calculations required at submittal
- Calculations must reference Climate Zone 8
- Plans after Jan 1, 2026 use 2025 Energy Code
