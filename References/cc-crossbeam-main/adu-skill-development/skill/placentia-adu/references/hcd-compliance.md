## HCD Compliance — Placentia

### Technical Assistance Letter

**Date:** November 27, 2023
**From:** California Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD)
**Topic:** City of Placentia Compliance with Ministerial Approval Requirements for ADUs
**PDF:** https://www.hcd.ca.gov/sites/default/files/docs/policy-and-research/ordinance-review-letters/placentia-adu-ta-112723.pdf

The letter addresses Placentia's ADU ordinance compliance with state law. Jurisdictions are required to respond within 30 days. Specific detailed findings were not fully extractable from the PDF.

### Subsequent Ordinance Updates

- **Ordinance O-2024-05** (September 17, 2024): Amended Chapter 23.69 (SB 9 Two-Unit Housing)
- **Ordinance O-2025-05** (July 15, 2025): Amended Chapter 23.73 (ADU/JADU) — most recent update

The July 2025 amendment likely addresses some or all of HCD's November 2023 findings.

### State Law Preemption Principle

Per § 23.73.010: "If there is any inconsistency between this chapter and mandatory requirements of state law, **state law shall control**."

This clause provides a built-in safety valve — even where Placentia's code may lag behind state law changes, the state provisions automatically apply.

### Known Potential Compliance Issues

**1. Owner Occupancy Language:**
- Placentia's code (§ 23.73.070) still references owner-occupancy requirements with a 2020-2025 exemption period
- State law (AB 976, effective 2025) permanently prohibits owner-occupancy requirements for ADUs
- **Practical effect:** Owner occupancy is NOT enforceable for ADUs despite local code language

**2. Building Separation Requirement:**
- Placentia requires 10 ft minimum between detached ADU and primary dwelling
- State law does not specify building separation for ADUs
- This may conflict with the state's mandate to not apply development standards that prevent a compliant ADU
- **Risk level:** Low — 10 ft is a reasonable fire/safety standard, but could be challenged if it prevents an otherwise conforming ADU on a small lot

**3. Entrance Visibility Restriction:**
- Placentia requires ADU entrance not be visible from street or on same side as primary entrance
- State law limits cities to "objective" design standards
- This standard could be considered subjective in application
- **Risk level:** Medium — depends on interpretation and whether it prevents ADU construction

**4. Exterior Stairway Restriction:**
- No exterior stairways "clearly visible from any adjacent street"
- Similar concern as entrance visibility — potentially subjective

### Housing Element Compliance

- Placentia's 6th Cycle Housing Element was **certified by HCD on February 29, 2024**
- Prior to certification, HCD identified issues with:
  - Racially/ethnically concentrated areas of poverty (RCAA) analysis
  - Realistic capacity and market trends
  - Discrete timing for program implementation
  - Nonvacant site analysis for lower-income housing
- All issues were resolved through revisions
