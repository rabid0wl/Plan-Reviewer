ADUs are permitted in all residential zones plus applicable specific plan and overlay areas (17 total zones per § 23.73.040):

| R-1 | Single-Family Residential | Standard single-family neighborhoods |
| R-2 | Low-Medium Density Multiple Family | 9 du/acre max |
| R-G | Medium Density Multiple-Family | Garden apartment style |
| R-3 | High Density Multiple-Family | 30 du/acre max |
| RPC | Residential Planned Community | Master-planned communities |
