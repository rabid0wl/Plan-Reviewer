## ADU Development Standards — Placentia

### Units Allowed Per Lot (§ 23.73.050)

**Single-family lots:**
- 1 ADU (attached or detached) + 1 JADU

**Multi-family lots:**
- **Conversions:** Up to 25% of existing units (min 1) within non-livable space (storage, boiler rooms, passageways, attics, basements, garages)
- **New detached:** Up to 2 detached ADUs, max 16 ft height, 4 ft side/rear setbacks

### Size Limits (§ 23.73.060)

| ADU Type | Minimum | Maximum |
|----------|---------|---------|
| Detached ADU | 150 sq ft | **1,200 sq ft** |
| Attached ADU | 150 sq ft | 50% of primary living area OR 1,200 sq ft (whichever less) |
| Conversion ADU | N/A | Existing structure size |
| JADU | N/A | 500 sq ft |

> **State law comparison:** State allows 850 sq ft (0-1 BR) / 1,000 sq ft (2+ BR). Placentia's 1,200 sq ft is **more permissive** than state law for all ADU types.

### Height Limits

| ADU Type | Maximum Height |
|----------|---------------|
| Detached ADU (by-right, ≤800 sq ft) | 16 ft |
| Detached ADU (general, per local code) | **20 ft** |
| Detached ADU on multifamily lot | 16 ft |
| Attached ADU | **25 ft** or underlying zone limit (whichever lower); up to 2 stories |
| Conversion ADU (existing structure) | No additional height restriction |

> **State law comparison:** State base is 16 ft detached. Placentia's 20 ft general detached height is **more permissive**. The 800 sq ft / 16 ft by-right provision aligns with state's mandatory minimum (Gov. Code § 65852.2).

### Setbacks

| ADU Type | Front | Side | Rear |
|----------|-------|------|------|
| Detached ADU (new construction) | Per underlying zone | **4 ft** min | **4 ft** min |
| Attached ADU | Per underlying zone | **4 ft** min | **4 ft** min |
| Conversion (existing structure) | Existing | Existing | Existing |
| JADU (within home) | N/A | N/A | N/A |

- If existing garage/accessory structure is converted, or ADU built in same location and dimensions, **no setback required** beyond existing
- Front yard and street-side setbacks follow underlying zone requirements

### Building Separation

**Minimum 10 feet** between a detached ADU and the primary dwelling and all other structures on the lot.

> **State law comparison:** State law does not specify a minimum building separation. This is a **Placentia-specific additional requirement**.

### State-Mandated Minimum (§ 23.73.060(b)(5))

Regardless of other local standards, an applicant is entitled to build:
- **800 sq ft** ADU
- Behind the front yard setback
- Max **20 ft** height
- **4 ft** side and rear setbacks

This is the "safe harbor" that the city cannot deny.

### Parking

| Situation | Parking Required |
|-----------|-----------------|
| General ADU (attached or detached) | **1 off-street space** |
| Within ½ mile of public transit (bus stop, train) | 0 (exempt) |
| Within historic district | 0 (exempt) |
| Within 1 block of car-share vehicle | 0 (exempt) |
| Conversion (garage/carport demolished or converted) | 0 (no replacement required) |
| Part of existing primary/accessory structure | 0 (exempt) |
| On-street permits required but not offered to ADU | 0 (exempt) |
| JADU | 0 (always exempt) |

**Additional parking rules:**
- May be tandem on existing driveway (blocking max 1 other required space)
- Parking may be located in setback areas
- When garage/carport is demolished or converted, city shall NOT require replacement parking

### Design/Architecture Standards

- Must **match architectural style** of primary dwelling
- Building materials, colors, and exterior finishes must be **substantially the same** as primary
- **Entrance** shall not be clearly visible from the street OR on same side as primary entrance
- Max **1 exterior entrance** per side of the ADU
- No **exterior stairways** clearly visible from any adjacent street

> **State law comparison:** State limits cities to objective design standards. Placentia's "match primary dwelling" and entrance/stairway visibility rules are **additional city-specific restrictions**.

### Other Development Standards

- Must be on a legally subdivided lot
- One ADU per residential lot (except as otherwise allowed by mandatory approval provisions)
- Fire sprinklers NOT required if not required in primary unit
- ADU within existing structure: exempt from lot coverage, max height, parking, and setback (fire safety minimum only)
- ADU does not count toward density calculations
- All utility installations underground
- Newly constructed, non-manufactured, detached ADUs require **solar PV** per California Energy Code
