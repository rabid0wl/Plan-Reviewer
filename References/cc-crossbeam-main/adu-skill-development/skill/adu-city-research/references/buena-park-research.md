## 3. Pre-Approved ADU Plans

**Status: No pre-approved ADU plan program found.**

As of February 2026, Buena Park does NOT appear to have published a library of pre-approved ADU plans per AB 1332. The city's ADU/JADU regulations page exists but contains no reference to pre-approved plans:

- https://www.buenapark.com/city_departments/community_development/planning_division/Accessory_Dwelling_Unit_ADU/Junior_Accessory_Dwelling_Unit_(JADU)_Regulations.php

AB 1332 required all local agencies to develop a program for pre-approval of ADU plans by January 1, 2025. Buena Park may be non-compliant or may have a minimal program not yet published online. Contact the Planning Division to verify.
