## Housing Context — Buena Park

### RHNA Allocation (6th Cycle, 2021-2029)

| Income Level | Units |
|-------------|-------|
| Very Low | 2,119 |
| Low | 1,343 |
| Moderate | 1,573 |
| Above Moderate | 3,884 |
| **Total** | **8,919** |

### Housing Capacity and Shortfall

- Total current site capacity: ~957 units
- **RHNA shortfall: 7,962 units** (3,372 lower-income, 1,226 moderate, 3,380 above moderate)
- City required to rezone approximately **287 acres (254 parcels)** per AB 1398

### ADU-Specific Housing Element Programs

- Goal: At least **2 ADUs per year** during 2021-2029 planning period (16 total minimum)
- ADU monitoring program to track progress against goals
- If not meeting goals by end of 2025, city will review and revise policies/efforts
- Housing element prepared by **RRM Design Group**

### What This Means for ADU Approvals

ADUs are counted toward RHNA compliance but represent a very small fraction of the 8,919-unit allocation. The massive shortfall (7,962 units) creates **political pressure to approve ADUs** — the city needs every unit it can get. This is a **very pro-ADU environment** from a policy perspective.

## SB 9 in Buena Park

Buena Park has adopted SB 9 regulations and received a **grade of "B"** (friendly implementation with standard regulations) from Homestead's SB 9 city guide.

### Key Local Requirements

| Requirement | Buena Park Standard |
|------------|-------------------|
| **Minimum lot to qualify for split** | 2,400 sq ft |
| **Owner-occupancy (lot split)** | One unit must be owner-occupied for 3 years |
| **Owner-occupancy (two-unit project)** | None — all units can be rented |
| **Rental restrictions (lot split)** | One unit must remain owner-occupied 3 years before sale |
| **Selling restriction (two-unit)** | Units cannot be sold separately (must remain as single entity) |

### Geographic Restrictions (per state law, applied locally)

**Prohibited areas**:
- Prime farmland
- Hazardous waste sites
- High/very high fire severity zones
- Conservation zones
- Vacant lots (very restrictive in BP)
- Historical zones

**Additional permits needed**:
- Earthquake fault lines
- High landslide/liquefaction risk
- FEMA flood zones
- Coastal areas

### SB 9 + ADU Compound Strategy

SB 9 lots can also have ADUs — compound density strategy. A single-family lot could potentially achieve:
- 2 primary units (via SB 9 lot split or two-unit development)
- Plus ADUs on each resulting lot
- This can yield 4+ units on what was originally a single-family lot

### SB 9 Design Standards

### Pre-Approved ADU Plans

**Status**: NOT FOUND — Buena Park does not appear to offer pre-approved ADU plans as of February 2026.
Per AB 1332 (2024), cities are encouraged to offer pre-approved plans.
