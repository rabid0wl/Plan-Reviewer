**Note**: Exact lot dimensions are in Table 19.308.050 on ecode360 but were not fully extractable via web search. Zone naming convention strongly suggests the lot area minimums above.

**Minimum lot for any RS zone**: 1 dwelling unit permitted on any lawfully established lot with net area of at least **2,500 sq ft**.

### RS Zone Development Standards

### Accessory Structure Standards (non-ADU)

| Standard | RS-6 / RS-8 | RS-10 / RS-16 |
|----------|------------|--------------|
| Max floor area | 600 sq ft | 600 sq ft |
| Max height | 1 story / 15 ft | 1 story / 15 ft |
| Side/rear setback | 5 ft | 10 ft |
| Street side (corner lot) | 10 ft | 15 ft |

**Note**: ADUs have their own setback rules (4 ft side/rear per § 19.348.010) that override these accessory structure setbacks.

### Fencing Standards (Ch. 19.328)

- Front property line: max 2 ft tall + 2 ft non-view-obscuring material
- 7 ft block wall/fence: must be set back 20 ft from front property line
- Side/rear: up to 6 ft (standard residential)

### Multifamily Zones

| Zone | Max Density | Max Coverage | Max Height |
|------|------------|-------------|-----------|
| **RM-20** | 24 du/net acre | 40% | 2 stories / 30 ft (varies — see below) |

**RM-20 height restrictions near SF zones**:
- Within 50 ft of RS zone: 1 story / 15 ft max
- 50+ ft from RS zone: 2 stories / 30 ft max

**RM-20 additional standards**:
- Non-conforming lot: width < 100 ft and/or area < 12,500 sq ft
- Min 300 sq ft common usable open space per unit
- Min 20% site landscaping

### ADU Impact on Lot Coverage

ADUs count toward the **40% lot coverage** limit for the underlying zone. This is often the binding constraint for ADU feasibility on smaller lots (RS-6 at ~6,000 sq ft = 2,400 sq ft max building footprint including primary dwelling + ADU).
