## ADU Development Standards — Buena Park

**Source**: Buena Park Municipal Code § 19.348.010, adopted June 2025
**ecode360 URL**: https://ecode360.com/42911497
**QCode URL**: https://library.qcode.us/lib/buena_park_ca/pub/city_code/item/title_19-division_3-chapter_19_348-19_348_010

### C.1 — Location

**Single-family zones**: ADUs allowed on lots with existing or proposed SF dwelling.
**Multifamily/mixed-use zones**: ADUs allowed on lots with existing or proposed MF dwelling.

**Types allowed**:
- Attached to primary dwelling
- Detached (standalone structure)
- Within existing primary residence (including attached garage or existing accessory structure)

**JADUs**: Only on SF-zoned lots with existing or proposed SF dwelling.

**Nonconformity note**: Per HCD Finding #4 and Gov. Code § 66322, city must allow ADUs on lots with zoning nonconformities. See `hcd-compliance.md`.

### C.2 — Minimum Lot Size and Allowable Density

**Not applicable** — Lot size and density requirements do not apply to ADU/JADU development.

### C.3 — Height of Structure

| Condition | Max Height |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Detached ADU (base)** | 16 feet from grade |
| **Attached ADU on SF lot** | 2 stories / 30 feet (or existing 2-story primary height, whichever is lower) |
| **Detached ADU on MF/mixed-use lot** with multistory dwelling | 20 feet |
| **Detached ADU near transit** (1/2 mile of major transit stop or high quality transit corridor per PRC § 21155) | 20 feet from existing finished grade to highest point of roof |

**State law comparison**: State allows 18 ft base (AB 2221). Buena Park's 20 ft near transit and 30 ft attached are **MORE permissive** than state minimums. See `transit-parking.md` for transit stop locations.

### C.4 — Access (Staircase Placement)

External access staircase (attached or detached) shall **NOT** be on street-facing elevation(s).

**State law comparison**: State law does not restrict staircase placement. This is a **Buena Park-specific restriction**.

### C.5 — Setbacks

| Condition | Setback |
|-----------|---------|
| **Converted existing structure** (same location/dimensions) | Maintain existing setbacks |
| **New construction ADU** (side yard) | 4 ft minimum |
| **New construction ADU** (rear yard) | 4 ft minimum |
| **Second story balcony/deck** (side or rear) | 5 ft minimum to property line |
| **Front yard setback** | ADU may be in front setback IF physically infeasible to build elsewhere while maintaining rear/side setbacks |

**Second story balcony/deck setback**: 5 ft is a **Buena Park-specific addition** — state law does not specify this.

**Front setback caution**: The "physical infeasibility" condition (C.5.c) was flagged in HCD Finding #5. Gov. Code § 66321(b)(3) says cities can't impose conditions that prevent an 800 sq ft ADU with 4-ft setbacks. This may still conflict. See `hcd-compliance.md`.

**Privacy screening**: Second story windows, decks, balconies, and landings shall provide screening to minimize privacy loss for neighbors.

### C.6 — Number of Dwelling Units

#### Single-Family Zone (C.6.a)

| Option | What's Allowed |
|--------|---------------|
| **i. ADU Conversion** | 1 ADU within existing SF dwelling, accessory structure, or proposed SF dwelling. May expand up to 150 sq ft for ingress/egress. |
| **ii. New ADU** | 1 detached or attached newly constructed ADU |
| **iii. JADU** | 1 JADU within SF dwelling (including attached garage). May expand up to 150 sq ft for ingress/egress. |
| **iv. Unit Combinations** | 1 JADU (per iii) + 1 detached ADU (per i or ii) |

**State law caution**: Gov. Code § 66323 allows converted ADU + detached ADU + JADU (all three). Buena Park's option (iv) allows JADU + 1 ADU but may not allow the full three-unit combination. See `hcd-compliance.md` Finding #6.

#### Multifamily Zones and Mixed Use Zones (C.6.b)

| Condition | Max Units |
|-----------|----------|
| **Proposed** MF dwelling | 2 newly constructed detached ADUs |
| **Existing** MF dwelling | 8 newly constructed detached ADUs (not to exceed # of existing non-accessory units) |
| **Converted from non-livable space** in existing MF structure | 25% of existing units (min 1) |
| **JADUs in MF zones** | NOT permitted |

### C.7 — Dwelling Size

| Type | Min | Max |
|------|-----|-----|
| ADU (0–1 bedroom) | 150 sq ft | 850 sq ft |
| ADU (2+ bedrooms) | 150 sq ft | 1,000 sq ft |
| JADU | 150 sq ft | 500 sq ft |

**State law comparison**: State default (no local ordinance) allows up to 1,200 sq ft for detached ADUs. Buena Park's 850/1,000 limits are within their right to set under Gov. Code § 66321(b)(2).

### C.8 — Off-Street Parking

**Default**: 1 parking space per ADU.
**Location**: Tandem on existing driveway, or driveway in side/rear yard. Must be lawfully paved.

**Exemptions** (no parking required if ANY ONE applies):
1. Within 1/2 mile walking distance of public transit
2. Within architecturally/historically significant historic district
3. Unit is within footprint of primary dwelling or accessory building
4. On-street parking permits required but not offered to ADU occupant
5. Car share vehicle within 1 block
6. Existing garage/carport demolished for ADU — no replacement parking required
7. ADU submitted with permit for new SF or MF dwelling on same lot (if ADU/parcel meets any other exemption)

**State law comparison**: 7 exemptions — **more exemptions** than state law's 6. Buena Park adds exemption #7 (new dwelling concurrent).
