## HCD Compliance Issues — Buena Park

### Background

California HCD reviewed Buena Park's ADU Ordinance No. 1736 (adopted March 26, 2024) and issued findings on **May 28, 2025** identifying 6 areas of non-compliance with state ADU law. The city revised the ordinance in **June 2025**, but several issues may not be fully resolved.

**HCD Findings Letter**: https://www.hcd.ca.gov/sites/default/files/docs/policy-and-research/ordinance-review-letters/buena-park-adu-findings-052825.pdf

### Key Principle: State Preemption

When a local ordinance is more restrictive than state law, **state law prevails**. When reviewing ADU plans or corrections, default to state law where the Buena Park ordinance conflicts.

### Finding #1 — Missing SB 1211 Multifamily ADU Allowances

**Issue**: Original ordinance didn't include allowances for 8 detached ADUs on existing MF lots and 2 detached on proposed MF lots.
**Code**: Gov. Code § 66323(a)(4)(A)(ii)-(iii)
**Status**: **Appears fixed** — Ordinance § 19.348.010(C.6.b) now includes 8/2 limits.

### Finding #2 — Missing AB 2533 Unpermitted ADU Provisions

**Issue**: Missing provisions for legalization of unpermitted ADUs built before January 1, 2020.
**Code**: Gov. Code § 66332(a)-(b), (d)-(f)
**Status**: **Not clearly addressed** in current ordinance text. State law applies directly.

**Practical impact**: If a property has an unpermitted ADU built before 2020, the 5-year amnesty provisions of Gov. Code § 66332 apply regardless of whether the city has adopted them locally.

### Finding #3 — Outdated Statutory Numbering

**Issue**: Ordinance references old code numbering (65852.2, 65852.22, 65852.26 instead of 66310-66342 per SB 477 renumbering).
**Code**: SB 477
**Status**: **Partially fixed** — Purpose section updated to 66314-66339, but C.12 (Utilities) still references 65852.2(f) instead of Gov. Code § 66324.

**Practical impact**: Minor — the substance is the same. Just note the correct current citations when referencing the ordinance.

### Finding #4 — Zoning Nonconformity Restriction

**Issue**: Ordinance appears to restrict ADUs on lots with zoning nonconformities.
**Code**: Gov. Code § 66322 — ADUs may be built regardless of existing nonconforming zoning conditions.
**Status**: **Not clearly addressed** — Ordinance C.1 still uses similar language.

**Practical impact**: If a lot has a nonconforming setback, lot coverage, or other zoning condition, an ADU can still be built. The nonconformity does not block the ADU permit. State law preempts.

### Finding #5 — Front Setback Physical Infeasibility Condition

**Issue**: Ordinance C.5.c allows ADU in front setback only if it's "physically infeasible" to build elsewhere.
**Code**: Gov. Code § 66321(b)(3) — Cities cannot impose conditions that prevent an 800 sq ft ADU with 4-ft setbacks.
**Status**: **Still present** in C.5.c.

**Practical impact**: If the only way to build an ADU of at least 800 sq ft with 4-ft setbacks is to place it in the front setback, the city likely cannot deny the permit even if C.5.c's "physical infeasibility" condition isn't met. State law preempts.

### Finding #6 — Unit Combinations Limited

**Issue**: Original ordinance limited single-family lots to "one of the following" ADU options, preventing the full combination allowed by state law.
**Code**: Gov. Code § 66323 — Allows converted ADU + detached new-construction ADU + JADU (all three on one lot).
**Status**: **Partially fixed** — C.6.a.iv now allows JADU + detached ADU. But it may still not allow the full three-unit combination (converted ADU + detached ADU + JADU).

**Practical impact**: If an applicant wants to build a converted ADU, a detached ADU, AND a JADU on a single-family lot, state law permits this combination. If the city denies based on C.6.a, state law preempts.
