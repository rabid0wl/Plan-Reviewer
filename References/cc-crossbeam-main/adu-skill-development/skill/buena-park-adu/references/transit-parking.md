## Transit Proximity — Buena Park

Transit proximity affects two ADU benefits in Buena Park:
1. **Height bonus**: Detached ADU up to 20 ft (instead of 16 ft) within 1/2 mile of major transit stop
2. **Parking exemption**: No parking required within 1/2 mile walking distance of public transit

### Major Transit Stops

#### Buena Park Metrolink Station
- **Address**: 8400 Lakeknoll Drive (at Dale Street), Buena Park, CA 90621
- **Lines**: Metrolink Orange County Line and 91/Perris Valley Line
- **Facilities**: 300-car parking lot, covered pedestrian overpass, clock tower landmark
- **Status**: **Major transit stop** under state definitions (commuter rail station)
- **URL**: https://metrolinktrains.com/rider-info/general-info/stations/buena-park/

Properties within **1/2 mile walking distance** of this station qualify for:
- 20-ft detached ADU height (per Buena Park ordinance § 19.348.010 C.3)
- Parking exemption (per § 19.348.010 C.8)

### Bus Transit Routes

| Route | Corridor | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| **Route 529 (OC Bus Rapid)** | Beach Boulevard (N-S) | Limited-stop rapid service; 13 stops; M-F 6am-6pm; 24-min peak frequency |
| Route 29 | Beach Boulevard (N-S) | Local service; connects La Habra to Huntington Beach; stops at Knott's Berry Farm |
| Route 25 | Connects to Fullerton Park-and-Ride | Links to Buena Park Metrolink Station |
| Route 38 | La Palma Avenue (E-W) | Connects to Lakewood and nearby communities |
| Route 123 | N-S route | Connects to Anaheim/Disneyland area |
| Route 460 | Long-distance | Connects to downtown LA via Norwalk/Fullerton |

**Route 529 (OC Bus Rapid)**: May qualify as a **high-quality transit corridor** under PRC § 21155 (frequent service on a fixed route). If so, properties within 1/2 mile of Beach Boulevard stops would also qualify for height bonus and parking exemption.

### Transit Zone ADU Implications

**Many properties along Beach Boulevard** are likely within 1/2 mile of transit — eligible for:
- 20-ft detached ADU height (Buena Park allows 20 ft, vs. state's 18 ft)
- Parking exemption (no parking space required)

**ADU height bonus table** (from ordinance):

| Location | Detached ADU Max Height |
|----------|------------------------|
| Standard (not near transit) | 16 ft |
| Within 1/2 mile of major transit stop | 20 ft |
| Within 1/2 mile of high-quality transit corridor | 20 ft |
| Attached ADU on SF lot | 30 ft / 2 stories |

### How to Determine Transit Proximity

To determine if a specific property qualifies:
1. **Metrolink station**: Measure walking distance (not straight-line) from 8400 Lakeknoll Dr
2. **Bus stops**: Measure walking distance from nearest Route 529 or other OCTA stop
3. **1/2 mile = ~2,640 ft** walking distance
4. Use Google Maps walking directions for accurate measurement
