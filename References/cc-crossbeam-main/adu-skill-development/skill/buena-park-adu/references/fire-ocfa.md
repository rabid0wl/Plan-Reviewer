**From OCFA** — Sprinklers may still be required if:
1. ADU is **attached** to home or not separated by code-required distance, AND combined area exceeds remodel/addition thresholds
2. Any portion of ADU is **more than 140 ft travel distance** from nearest usable fire lane (usually public street or 20-ft-wide private road)
3. **Water supply from hydrants** is less than minimum required by code
4. Location of ADU **adversely impacts emergency response or safety**
5. Project is **referred to OCFA** by city building or planning department

### OCFA ADU Information Bulletin (IB-01-21)

### OCFA Road Width / Restricted Areas

From Buena Park ordinance (§ 19.348.010 C.13):
- ADU prohibited on lots fronting roads **narrower than OCFA Master Plans minimum width** UNLESS:
  - (a) 1 on-site parking space per bedroom, AND
  - (b) replacement parking for any spaces lost/converted, OR
  - (c) CUP per § 19.128.020

### Local Fire Code Amendments

**Buena Park Title 16 — Fire Safety** (https://ecode360.com/42924735):
- 2022 California Fire Code adopted (IFC 2021 Edition, including all appendices)
- Local amendments include:
  - Automatic fire-extinguishing system required when total building area exceeds **5,000 sq ft** or is **more than 2 stories**
  - Sprinkler system design: shall not exceed **90% of water supply capacity** (exception: static pressure > 100 psi)

### Fire Hazard Zones

- **Majority of Buena Park**: NOT in a Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zone (VHFHSZ) — predominantly flat, urbanized land
- **Small northern section**: IS within a Fire Hazard Severity Zone per updated CAL FIRE FHSZ maps (March 2024)
- City's FHSZ page: https://www.buenapark.com/residents/disaster_preparedness/fire_hazard_severity_zones.php

**Impact on ADUs**:
- Properties in northern FHSZ area may require Chapter 7A ignition-resistant construction and defensible space (adds cost)
- For most of Buena Park, no VHFHSZ constraint on ADUs
