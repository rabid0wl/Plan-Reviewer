## Change Log

### 1. JADU owner-occupancy now depends on shared sanitation (AB 1154)

| Field | Value |

| **Reference file(s)** | `unit-types-jadu.md`, `ownership-use.md` |
| **What to update** | Current rule says owner-occupancy is always required for JADUs. Must now distinguish: shared sanitation = owner-occupancy required; separate sanitation = not required |
