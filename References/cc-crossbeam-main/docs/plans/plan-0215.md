# Plan — Sunday Feb 15 (Final Day)

**Submission deadline:** Mon Feb 16, 12:00 PM PST (3:00 PM EST)

## Status: Both Flows Pass in Cloud

| Test | Flow | Status | Cost | Time |
|------|------|--------|------|------|
| CV4 | City Review (15-page) | PASS | $8.69 | 16 min |
| CV5 Phase 1 | Contractor Analysis | PASS | $4.46 | 11 min |
| CV5 Phase 2 | Contractor Response | PASS | $1.46 | 6 min |
| CV5 E2E | Full Contractor Flow | PASS | $5.92 | 17 min |

## Minor Bugs Still Alive

- **Contractor questions insertion** — `question_groups` nested structure doesn't match the flat array the insert code expects. Questions don't auto-populate in the UI. See `plan-fix-contractor-questions.md` for the fix plan.
- **"Fill demo answers" button** — check if it's wired up to the API or just client-side.
- **Answer versioning** — contractor_answers table needs to link to a specific output version so re-runs don't mix old answers with new questions. Covered in the fix plan.

## Not Tested (and that's OK for demo)

- Fresh user upload flow (we use pre-seeded demo projects b1/b2)
- Different plan set (manifest fixture is hardcoded to Placentia)
- Fine for demo — just don't pretend it handles arbitrary uploads live

## Judging Weights

- Demo: 30% (biggest)
- Impact: 25%
- Opus 4.6 Use: 25%
- Depth & Execution: 20%

## Tier 1 — Video (Mike, today)

The video IS the submission. 30% of the score.

**Story arc:**
1. Problem: Contractor gets scary corrections letter from the city
2. Magic: AI reads it, researches codes, asks smart questions, generates response
3. Output: Professional letter ready to submit back to the city

**Opus 4.6 angle (25%):** Narrate the multi-agent orchestration — "Opus coordinates specialist agents that each review different disciplines simultaneously." The file-based coordination pattern is genuinely clever. Call it out.

**Impact angle (25%):** Mayor of Buena Park interview adds legitimacy. Show the real-world pain point.

## Tier 2 — Async Agent Work (while Mike does video)

### 2.1 Fix contractor questions insertion + answer versioning
- **Plan doc:** `plan-fix-contractor-questions.md`
- **Priority:** CRITICAL if screen-recording the live app
- **Scope:** ~30 min fix, server-side only

### 2.2 Pre-run both flows and leave results cached
- So video can show output instantly
- Optionally show "live run" as fast-forward or separate clip
- Don't make the viewer wait 16 minutes

### 2.3 Output rendering polish
- Another agent may have already done this — Mike to verify
- `draft_corrections.md` and `response_letter.md` should render beautifully
- If markdown viewer is basic, small shadcn upgrade makes it professional

### 2.4 Landing page copy + "How It Works"
- **Not a product sales page** — it's for hackathon judges
- Informative: what is CrossBeam, what problem does it solve, how does it work
- "How It Works" section with architecture flow is essential for judges
- Keep it clean, let the demo speak for itself

### 2.5 README cleanup
- Judges may browse GitHub
- Clean project description, architecture overview, how to run locally
- Link to the deployed app

## Tier 3 — Skip Unless Time

- Flow 3 (City Pre-Screening) — vision/roadmap only, don't build
- New features — the product works, polish what exists
- Performance optimization — current costs/timing are fine for demo
- Error states / loading states — nice to have but not critical

## Notes for Agents

- **Server deploys via GitHub Actions** — push to `main` when `server/**` changes. Don't suggest manual deploys.
- **Frontend deploys via Vercel** — push to `main` auto-deploys.
- **Demo projects:** City (b1): `b0000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001`, Contractor (b2): `b0000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000002`
- **API key:** set in Vercel env vars, use `vercel env pull --environment production` to get it
- **Supabase project:** `bhjrpklzqyrelnhexhlj`
- **Cloud Run:** `crossbeam-server` in `us-central1`, deployed via `.github/workflows/deploy-server.yml`
