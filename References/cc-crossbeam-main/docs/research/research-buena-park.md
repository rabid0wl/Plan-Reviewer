## 1. ADU Ordinance — Section 19.348.010

**Ordinance**: Buena Park Municipal Code Section 19.348.010
**Adopted**: June 2025 (revised after HCD findings)
**Previous version**: Ordinance No. 1736, adopted March 26, 2024
**Gov Code reference**: §§ 66314–66339 (updated from old 65852.2 numbering)
**ecode360 URL**: https://ecode360.com/42911497 (Special Requirements for Certain Uses)
**QCode URL**: https://library.qcode.us/lib/buena_park_ca/pub/city_code/item/title_19-division_3-chapter_19_348-19_348_010

### A. Purpose
Regulations for ADUs and JADUs per Gov. Code §§ 66314–66339. Includes manufactured homes (HSC § 18007). Goal: increase supply of smaller/affordable housing while maintaining neighborhood compatibility.

### B. Submittal Requirements and Application Processing
- **Required documents**: Site plan, floor plan, demolition plan, and elevations
- **Approval timeline**: 60 days, ministerial, no discretionary review or public hearing
- **Extension**: City and applicant may agree to additional time with written request
- **Denial process**: Within 60 days, return full written comments listing deficient items with description of how to correct
- **Garage replacement**: Demolition permit required, reviewed concurrently with ADU application

### C. Development Standards

#### C.1 — Location
- **Single-family zones**: ADUs allowed on lots with existing or proposed SF dwelling
- **Multifamily/mixed-use zones**: ADUs allowed on lots with existing or proposed MF dwelling
- **Types**: Attached, detached, or within existing primary residence (including attached garage or existing accessory structure)
- **JADUs**: Only on SF-zoned lots with existing or proposed SF dwelling
- **Nonconformity note**: Per HCD finding #4, city must allow ADUs on lots with zoning nonconformities (Gov. Code § 66322)

#### C.2 — Minimum Lot Size and Allowable Density
- **Not applicable** — Lot size and density requirements do not apply to ADU/JADU development

#### C.3 — Height of Structure
| Condition | Max Height |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Detached ADU (base)** | 16 feet from grade |
| **Attached ADU on SF lot** | 2 stories / 30 feet (or existing 2-story primary height, whichever is lower) |
| **Detached ADU on multifamily/mixed-use lot** with multistory dwelling | 20 feet |
| **Detached ADU near transit** (½ mile of major transit stop or high quality transit corridor per PRC § 21155) | 20 feet from existing finished grade to highest point of roof |

**Note**: State law allows 18 ft base (AB 2221). Buena Park's 20 ft near transit and 30 ft attached are MORE permissive than state minimums.

#### C.4 — Access (Staircase Placement)
- External access staircase (attached or detached) shall NOT be on street-facing elevation(s)

#### C.5 — Setbacks
| Condition | Setback |
|-----------|---------|
| **Converted existing structure** (same location/dimensions) | Maintain existing setbacks |
| **New construction ADU** (side yard) | 4 ft minimum |
| **New construction ADU** (rear yard) | 4 ft minimum |
| **Second story balcony/deck** (side or rear) | 5 ft minimum to property line |
| **Front yard setback** | ADU may be in front setback IF physically infeasible to build elsewhere while maintaining rear/side setbacks |

**HCD Finding #5 concern**: The front setback "physical infeasibility" condition may still conflict with Gov. Code § 66321(b)(3) which says cities can't impose conditions that prevent an 800 sq ft ADU with 4-ft setbacks. This was flagged in the HCD letter but may or may not have been fully resolved in the June 2025 revision.

**Privacy screening**: Second story windows, decks, balconies, and landings shall provide screening to minimize privacy loss for neighbors.

#### C.6 — Number of Dwelling Units

**Single-Family Zone (C.6.a)**:
| Option | What's Allowed |
|--------|---------------|
| **i. ADU Conversion** | 1 ADU within existing SF dwelling, accessory structure, or proposed SF dwelling. May expand up to 150 sq ft for ingress/egress. |
| **ii. New ADU** | 1 detached or attached newly constructed ADU |
| **iii. JADU** | 1 JADU within SF dwelling (including attached garage). May expand up to 150 sq ft for ingress/egress. |
| **iv. Unit Combinations** | 1 JADU (per iii) + 1 detached ADU (per i or ii) |

**HCD Finding #6 concern**: The original ordinance limited to "one of the following" — the updated version (iv) now allows JADU + detached ADU. However, state law (Gov. Code § 66323) allows converted ADU + detached ADU + JADU (all three). The June 2025 revision partially addresses this but may still be more restrictive than state law on the full three-unit combination.

**Multifamily Zones and Mixed Use Zones (C.6.b)**:
| Condition | Max Units |
|-----------|----------|
| **Proposed** MF dwelling | 2 newly constructed detached ADUs |
| **Existing** MF dwelling | 8 newly constructed detached ADUs (not to exceed # of existing non-accessory units) |
| **Converted from non-livable space** in existing MF structure | 25% of existing units (min 1) |
| **JADUs in MF zones** | NOT permitted |

#### C.7 — Dwelling Size
| Type | Min | Max |
|------|-----|-----|
| ADU (0–1 bedroom) | 150 sq ft | 850 sq ft |
| ADU (2+ bedrooms) | 150 sq ft | 1,000 sq ft |
| JADU | 150 sq ft | 500 sq ft |

**Note**: The ordinance doesn't explicitly state a 1,200 sq ft max for detached ADUs without a local ordinance. State law default (Gov. Code § 66321(b)(2)) sets 1,200 sq ft as the max when no local ordinance applies. Buena Park's 850/1,000 limits are within their right to set.

#### C.8 — Off-Street Parking
- **Default**: 1 parking space per ADU
- **Location**: Tandem on existing driveway, or driveway in side/rear yard. Must be lawfully paved.
- **Exemptions** (no parking required if ANY ONE applies):
  1. Within ½ mile walking distance of public transit

  5. Car share vehicle within 1 block
  6. Existing garage/carport demolished for ADU — no replacement parking required
  7. ADU submitted with permit for new SF or MF dwelling on same lot (if ADU/parcel meets any other exemption)

#### C.9 — Location of Parking (preference order)
1. Garage, carport, or covered space on driveway (within setbacks)
2. Uncovered tandem space on driveway
3. Within required street side yard setback
4. Within required side or rear yard setback (with screening)
5. Within required front yard setback
- Subject to Building Code egress and fire/life safety conditions
- Must be maintained and available for parking at all times

#### C.10 — Vehicular Access

- No passageway to street required
- ADU/JADU must have independent exterior access from existing residence

#### C.11 — Way Finding
- Address display per current CRC as adopted/amended by city

#### C.12 — Utilities
- May be metered with primary dwelling (per Gov. Code § 65852.2(f))
- **Note**: Ordinance still references old 65852.2(f) — should be updated to Gov. Code § 66324

#### C.13 — Restricted Areas
- No ADU/JADU where roadways, utilities, and services are inadequate per objective/published thresholds
- OCFA road width standards: ADU prohibited on lots fronting roads narrower than OCFA Master Plans minimum UNLESS:
  - (a) 1 on-site parking space per bedroom, AND
  - (b) replacement parking for any spaces lost/converted, OR
  - (c) CUP per § 19.128.020 with findings on adequate street access/traffic and utilities

#### C.14 — Building and Fire Codes
- Comply with all current state and local building/fire codes
- **Fire sprinklers**: NOT required for ADU/JADU if not required for primary residence
- ADU construction alone shall NOT trigger sprinkler requirement in existing main dwelling

#### C.15 — Park Fees
- ADUs ≥ 750 sq ft: proportionate Park Land Dedications and In-Lieu Fees per adopted Development Impact Fee Schedule
- ADUs < 750 sq ft: **exempt** from park fees (per state law § 66311.5)

#### C.16 — Objective Design Standards
- **Match primary dwelling**: roofing material, roof design (slope, style), fascia, exterior finish, color, doors, windows, garage door, architectural enhancements
- **Garage conversion**: Visible garage door must be eliminated and replaced with architecturally consistent wall/windows/door
- **Privacy**: Second story windows and glass doors must use offset/clerestory placement or opaque/view-obscuring glass
- **Manufactured homes**: Skirting required for grade appearance. Synthetic materials OK if similar appearance and equivalent durability. Siding from grade to roof (exception: approved perimeter foundation)

#### C.17 — Separate Sale Prohibited
- ADU cannot be sold separately from primary residence

#### C.18 — Short-Term Rental Prohibited
- Minimum rental term: 30 days

## 2. HCD Findings Letter (May 28, 2025)

HCD reviewed Ordinance No. 1736 (adopted March 2024) and found 6 non-compliance items:

| # | Issue | Code Reference | Status in June 2025 Revision |
|---|-------|---------------|------------------------------|
| 1 | Missing SB 1211 multifamily ADU allowances (8 detached on existing MF, 2 on proposed MF) | Gov. Code § 66323(a)(4)(A)(ii)-(iii) | **Appears fixed** — C.6.b now includes 8/2 limits |
| 2 | Missing AB 2533 unpermitted ADU provisions | Gov. Code § 66332(a)-(b), (d)-(f) | **Not clearly addressed** in ordinance text |
| 3 | Outdated statutory numbering (65852.2, 65852.22, 65852.26 → 66310-66342) | SB 477 renumbering | **Partially fixed** — purpose section updated to 66314-66339, but C.12 still references 65852.2(f) |
| 4 | Zoning nonconformity restriction | Gov. Code § 66322 | **Not clearly addressed** — C.1 still uses similar language |
| 5 | Front setback physical infeasibility condition | Gov. Code § 66321(b)(3) | **Still present** in C.5.c |
| 6 | Unit combinations limited to "one of the following" | Gov. Code § 66323 | **Partially fixed** — C.6.a.iv now allows JADU + detached ADU, but may not allow all 3 (converted + detached + JADU) |

**Key takeaway for plan review**: Several HCD findings may not be fully resolved. When reviewing ADU plans, default to state law where the local ordinance is more restrictive — state law preempts.

## 18. Research Gaps / Follow-Up Needed

1. **Full fee schedule**: Exact building permit fees, plan check fees, and development impact fee amounts not found online. Need to contact city or find adopted fee resolution.
2. **Standard construction details**: No city-published standard details found. May not exist or may be distributed only at counter.
3. **AB 2533 compliance**: Unpermitted ADU legalization provisions — not clearly addressed in June 2025 ordinance. Verify with city.
4. **Full unit combination compliance**: Whether the city truly allows converted ADU + detached ADU + JADU (all three) per Gov. Code § 66323.
5. **Front setback condition**: HCD Finding #5 — verify if the "physical infeasibility" condition was removed or amended.
6. **Zoning nonconformity**: HCD Finding #4 — verify language in current ordinance.
7. **Water/sewer connection fees**: Specific ADU connection fee amounts.
8. **Grading details**: Specific drainage slope requirements, permit thresholds from OC Grading Code as adopted.
9. **RS zone development standards table**: Exact numbers from Table 19.308.050 (lot dimensions by zone).
10. **Building code local amendments**: Full list of Buena Park's specific amendments to CBC/CRC/CPC.
