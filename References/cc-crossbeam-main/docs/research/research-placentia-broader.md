# Placentia, California -- Broader ADU Regulatory Environment Research

**Researched:** February 12, 2026
**Purpose:** Topics that may NOT be fully covered in Placentia's municipal code or city website, but matter for ADU permitting.

---

## 1. Fire Service

### Provider: Placentia Fire and Life Safety Department (City-run)

Placentia runs its **own municipal fire department** -- the Placentia Fire and Life Safety Department. This is notable because most Orange County cities contract with the Orange County Fire Authority (OCFA).

**History:**
- 1975: Original Placentia Fire Department was disbanded
- 1975-2020: OCFA provided fire protection and EMS out of two city-owned fire stations
- 1995: After the OC bankruptcy, OCFA spun off as a JPA; Placentia was a founding "cash contract" city
- June 2019: City Council voted to form its own fire department and contract with Lynch EMS for 911/ALS paramedic services
- June 2020: Placentia Fire and Life Safety Department took over operations from OCFA

**Performance (post-transition):**
- 40% more daily calls handled in first three months
- Response times over 3 minutes faster than under OCFA
- Mutual aid dependency reduced by 85%
- Replaced CalPERS pensions with 401(k) plans for cost savings
- Installed emergency vehicle traffic signal preemption at major intersections
- Part-time firefighters and trained reserve volunteers supplement staffing

**Fire Stations:**
- **Station 1:** 110 South Bradford Avenue, Placentia, CA 92870
- **Station 2:** 1530 North Valencia Avenue, Placentia, CA 92870

**Fire Plan Submittals:**
- As of March 20, 2023, all fire-related plan checks and permitting are handled by Placentia Fire and Life Safety Department (not OCFA)
- Contact: (714) 993-8135
- Location: 401 E Chapman Avenue, Placentia, CA 92870

### ADU Sprinkler Requirements

Per California Government Code section 65852.2: ADUs are NOT required to provide fire sprinklers if sprinklers are not required for the primary residence. Building an ADU does NOT trigger a sprinkler requirement in the existing primary dwelling.

Placentia's fire department has published an "Access and Water 2023 Guideline" covering access and water supply requirements.

### Fire Hazard Severity Zones (FHSZ)

- **Ordinance No. O-2025-04** adopted June 17, 2025 designating Fire Hazard Severity Zones in Placentia
- The City posted new Local Responsibility Area (LRA) FHSZ maps for public comment prior to adoption
- Placentia is largely an urbanized flatland city; most areas are likely NOT in Very High FHSZ, but the eastern hills near Carbon Canyon may have designations
- The interactive CAL FIRE FHSZ Viewer can confirm specific parcel-level designations

**Why it matters for ADUs:** Properties in Very High FHSZ may face additional defensible space, building material, and access requirements under Chapter 7A of the CBC.

## 2. Transit

### Metrolink -- Placentia Station (Under Development)

The Placentia Metrolink Station is a planned infill station on the **91/Perris Valley Line** (now called the IE-OC Line). It will be Orange County's 13th Metrolink station.

**Project Details:**
- Total cost: **$35 million** (City contributing $5.4 million)
- Location: Old Town Placentia area, near Chapman Avenue
- Includes a 246-space shared-use multi-story parking structure
- Expected initial operations: 10 daily train trips, 530 daily passengers, 350 parked vehicles
- Line serves: Riverside, Fullerton, Downtown Los Angeles
- Closest Metrolink station in proximity to Cal State Fullerton

**Status (as of early 2026):**
- OCTA approved the project in June 2016
- Construction was expected to begin in 2020 with a June 2022 opening
- Project was put "on hold" until mid-2024
- As of April 2025, the project had still **not broken ground**
- No confirmed opening date as of this research

### OCTA Bus Routes

Bus routes serving Placentia include:
- **Route 26**
- **Route 30**
- **Route 57**
- **Route 59**
- **Route 71** (Yorba Linda to Newport Beach via Tustin Ave/Red Hill Ave/Newport Blvd)
- **Route 123**
- **Route 129**

Full OCTA bus schedules: https://www.octa.net/getting-around/bus/oc-bus/routes-and-schedules/routes-and-schedules

### Transit-Adjacent ADU Bonuses

**Parking Exemption:** No additional parking can be required for an ADU located within **1/2 mile walking distance** of public transit.

**Height Bonus:** If the property is within 1/2 mile walking distance of a public transit station OR the existing building is 2 stories, the detached ADU is allowed up to **18 feet** in height (vs. standard 16 feet).

**Note:** Even though the Placentia Metrolink station has not yet opened, existing OCTA bus stops may qualify as "public transit" for these exemptions. The definition of "public transit" under state ADU law includes bus stops with regular service.

### Transit Oriented Development (TOD) District

Placentia has established a **TOD Packing House District** centered around the future Metrolink station:
- Mixture of housing, office, retail integrated into walkable neighborhood
- Located within half-mile of the planned station
- Expected to generate up to **$495 million** in public and private investment
- **Key fee exemption:** New development within the TOD area is **NOT subject to** Sewer Impact Fee, Traffic Impact Fee, or Storm Drainage Impact Fee
- Has its own separate development impact fee schedule (TOD DIFs)
- Enhanced Infrastructure Financing District (EIFD) also established

## 3. Climate Zone

**Placentia is in California Title 24 Climate Zone 8.**

Climate Zone 8 covers much of coastal and near-coastal Southern California, including cities like Irvine, Tustin, Orange, Fullerton, Anaheim, Norwalk, and Downey.

**Implications for ADU construction:**
- Specific insulation R-values, window U-factors, and SHGC values per Climate Zone 8 prescriptive requirements
- HVAC sizing based on Zone 8 weather data
- Solar PV requirements apply to new detached ADUs (non-manufactured)
- Title 24 energy compliance (Part 6) must be included in plan check submittals

**To verify for a specific address:** Use the California Building Climate Zone Finder at the CEC website.

## 4. Housing Element / RHNA

### 6th Cycle RHNA Allocation (2021-2029)

Placentia's total RHNA allocation: **4,374 units** (some sources cite 4,398 from SCAG's final plan)

| Income Level | Units |
|---|---|
| Extremely Low & Very Low Income | 1,231 |
| Low Income | 680 |
| Moderate Income | 770 |
| Above Moderate Income | 1,693 |
| **Total** | **4,374** |

### Housing Element Status

- **March 15, 2022:** City Council unanimously approved the 6th Cycle Housing Element with a "Common Sense" CEQA exemption
- **February 16-22, 2024:** Seven-day public review period for updated element
- **February 29, 2024:** HCD certification letter received -- element is **CERTIFIED**
- Placentia's Housing Element identifies adequate sites zoned and available to meet RHNA across all income levels

### HCD Review Issues (prior to certification)

HCD's initial review identified issues including:
- Addressing patterns of racially/ethnically concentrated areas of poverty (RCAAs) at neighborhood/tract level
- Additional information needed on realistic capacity (market trends, approved projects)
- Specification of discrete timing for program implementation
- Demonstrating that nonvacant sites for lower-income housing are not impediments to development

These were resolved to achieve the February 2024 certification.

### Community Data
- Population: ~50,533
- Median property value: $702,200
- Single-family properties: 12,093

## 5. SB 9 (Urban Lot Split / Two-Unit Housing Development)

### Placentia Has Adopted SB 9 Regulations

Placentia's municipal code includes **Chapter 23.13 -- Two Unit Housing Developments**, which implements SB 9 locally.

**Key provisions (from Placentia Municipal Code):**
- A "housing development" = no more than 2 residential units in a single-family zone
- Two units may be two new units OR one new unit + one existing unit
- City shall **ministerially approve** qualifying two-unit developments
- Parcel must be in a single-family residential zone
- Parcel must be at least partially in an urbanized area/urban cluster (Census Bureau designation)
- Restrictions on development in earthquake fault zones and special flood hazard areas
- Municipal code legislation through Ordinance No. O-2024-05 (adopted September 17, 2024)

**SB 9 lot splits** are eligible in Placentia, allowing property division for duplex/triplex development.

**Note:** Specific local objective standards for setbacks, lot size minimums, etc. under the SB 9 ordinance were not fully extracted from ecode360 due to access limitations. Contact the Planning Department for details.

- DIFs are subject to periodic updates by City Council

### TOD Area Fee Exemptions

Development within the TOD area is **NOT subject to:**
- Sewer Impact Fee
- Traffic Impact Fee
- Storm Drainage Impact Fee

(TOD area has its own separate DIF schedule)

### School District Fees (Separate from City)

Placentia-Yorba Linda USD levies developer fees directly:
- **Residential:** $3.48/sq ft (for new/additional 500 sq ft and above)
- **Commercial rates vary:** $0.227 - $0.56/sq ft depending on use type

## 7. Utility Providers

### Water

**Primary:** Golden State Water Company (GSWC)
- Serves approximately 16,200 customers in Placentia and portions of Anaheim, Cowan Heights, Lemon Heights, Orange, and Yorba Linda
- Serving the Placentia area since 1929
- Contact: (909) 394-2272

- Contact: (714) 701-3000

### ADU Water Connection Implications (GSWC)

When adding an ADU to an existing GSWC water service:
- **Option A:** Keep single service connection -- rate changes from Single-Family Residential to Multi-Family Residential; may require a larger water meter (and higher service charge)
- **Option B:** Request a separate water service for the ADU -- both units stay on Single-Family Residential rate, but all costs for the second service are at the customer's expense

### Sewer

**Collection system:** City of Placentia operates and maintains **84 miles** of gravity sanitary sewer pipelines serving the majority of parcels within the 6.6 square mile city limits.

**Treatment:** Orange County Sanitation District (OCSD) -- the City conveys untreated wastewater to OCSD's trunk sewer system via **35 separate connections**. OCSD treats and disposes of the City's wastewater.

**Partial area:** Yorba Linda Water District (YLWD) provides sewer services to portions of Placentia (particularly the Locke Ranch area).

**Sewer Rates (effective July 1, 2025):**
- Single-Family Residential: $0.81/CCF
- Multi-Family Residential: $0.92/CCF

## 8. Stormwater / Grading

### NPDES / MS4 Permit

Placentia is part of the **North Orange County Stormwater Program** -- a regulatory compliance partnership of the County of Orange, OC Flood Control District, and 26 cities.

**Regulatory authority:** Santa Ana Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB)
**Permit type:** Phase I MS4 Permit
**Municipal Code:** Title 16, Chapter 16.20

### Stormwater Requirements for Development

- Two separate systems: sanitary sewers (treated) and storm drains (untreated -- discharges to channels, rivers, and ocean)
- Non-exempt **Priority Development Projects** must prepare a **Water Quality Management Plan (WQMP)** prior to grading or building permit issuance
- WQMP describes permanent post-construction Best Management Practices (BMPs)
- **Low Impact Development (LID)** principles are required -- site design to mimic pre-development hydrology
- Placentia provides a WQMP template through their document center

### Construction Stormwater (CGP)

- Projects disturbing **1 acre or more** require coverage under the state Construction General Permit (CGP)
- Requires a **Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP)** prepared by a Qualified SWPPP Practitioner (QSP)
- Most individual ADU projects on residential lots are well under 1 acre, so CGP is typically NOT triggered for a single ADU project

### Grading

- Placentia has its own **grading permit application** through Public Works - Engineering Services
- The city follows its own grading code (not the unincorporated OC grading code)
- The Orange County Grading Manual (2017 Edition) applies to unincorporated areas, not Placentia proper
- Contact Public Works at (714) 993-8131 for grading requirements

## 10. HCD Compliance

### HCD ADU Ordinance Technical Assistance Letter

HCD issued a **technical assistance letter** to Placentia dated **November 27, 2023** regarding compliance with ministerial approval requirements for ADUs.

**Document:** "City of Placentia Compliance with Ministerial Approval"
**URL:** https://www.hcd.ca.gov/sites/default/files/docs/policy-and-research/ordinance-review-letters/placentia-adu-ta-112723.pdf

## Key Takeaways for ADU Permitting

1. **Fire service is city-run** (not OCFA) -- plan reviews go through Placentia Fire, not OCFA
2. **Metrolink station not yet built** -- transit parking/height exemptions currently depend on OCTA bus stops, not the future station
3. **Climate Zone 8** for Title 24 compliance
4. **RHNA allocation of 4,374 units** means the city has strong motivation to approve housing including ADUs
5. **HCD is watching** -- November 2023 technical assistance letter on ADU ordinance compliance
6. **SB 9 adopted** -- Chapter 23.13 allows two-unit developments ministerially
7. **Impact fees exempt under 750 sq ft** -- strong incentive to design ADUs just under this threshold
8. **TOD district has special fee exemptions** -- significant savings for properties near Old Town/future Metrolink station
9. **Water provider matters** -- GSWC will reclassify to multi-family rates OR require costly second service connection
10. **School fees apply over 500 sq ft** at $3.48/sq ft -- an 800 sq ft ADU = ~$2,784 in school fees alone
11. **Sewer is city-operated** with OCSD treatment -- sewer connection capacity is managed by the city
12. **Owner occupancy no longer enforceable** per current state law, despite Placentia's local code language
