## 18. Research Gaps

1. **HCD technical assistance letter details** — PDF not fully extractable; specific findings unknown
2. **DIF dollar amounts** — Actual fee-per-unit amounts not published online; need to contact city or access fee calculator
3. **R-G (Medium Density) zone standards** — Not fully accessible from ecode360
4. **R-A zone development standards** — Not fully extracted
5. **Local fire code amendment details** — Referenced as attachment but not fully extracted
6. **Standard construction details** — City website references standard plans but specific catalog not found
7. **Exact FHSZ boundaries** — Known that eastern Carbon Canyon area may be designated; verify via CAL FIRE viewer
