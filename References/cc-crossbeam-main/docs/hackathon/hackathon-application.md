What is your experience level building with Claude Code? (Novice, Experienced, Expert)

I would say experienced with Claude Code, maybe even expert, but put it as experience because Claude Code is something I don't really know how to code. I just know how to use Claude Code really damn good.

Got it-I'll put you down as "Experienced." What project are you most proud of building with Claude Code? Could you describe it a bit?

Yeah, so I built a preorder system for my cousin's butcher shop in Brooklyn, and it's done over $100K of revenue. What I'm proud about it is it's a small, butcher shop, employee-owned, and their previous pre-order system would bend them over with fees, trying to take percentages of the orders and stuff like that. So, we've been using Claude Code. We quickly spun up a pre-order system that with a cool storefront and a really easy-to-use back-end/admin portal. We saved his shop and their employees, the people who own it, a ton of money. It's literally done over $100,000 of revenue on the pre-order system for butcher shop. So, that's probably the one I'm most proud of, the one just because the real-world results.

The product/project I'm most proud of building because it was just like I think it's a really cool thing is I'm a personal injury lawyer. I've automated my whole system from like I built using Claude Code. I built a like basically a intake phone call note system and then from there it helps me fill out my project files and then and then now it even writes my own demand letters like that all using Claude Code. I think that like from an agentic real-world perspective, it just speeds me up. It's basically automated my job. It's super cool.

That’s really impressive! Two great examples with big impact. Now, what do you want to build for this hackathon?

Okay, so I'm in the discovery phases for this project already. I saw the hackathon and I was like, "Ah, this could be kind of fun to do." A bunch of my buddies are contractors here in California. We have a housing crisis, but after talking to my buddies, I think it's less of a housing crisis and more of a permit crisis because the cities take forever. They have a massive backlog of approving permits, and then even most of the time they don't even approve it the first time. They give themselves 60 days to correct your permits, then it's like the contractors who are busy with other jobs have to go pretend, act like they're lawyers, and go get a permit. Their permit application is like perfect and these things are very, very thick, 15-30 page permits with plans and all that type of stuff. Very dense and then like getting the legal lease right, you know? Most of the time.

Now there's obviously parts of it that AI won't be able to do like engineering loads and other stuff I've been looking into. Anyways, so I wanna build a project, I'm calling it Project Crossbeam, and what it is is it right now it's gonna help my buddies build ADUs get their permits. So at the beginning of it, it started using Cloud Agents SDK. And then what it does is allows the contractor to kind of like use the ask- They don't even know this but it's used the tool Ask User Question. So then the cloud agents ask them questions about where they're gonna build the ADU, what type of ADU, what's the property like, etc. And then it creates a checklist for them to help build their permit out. Then when they- After the permit application comes in, The really exciting one is the correction flow that I've kind of identified, and this is where I got to go build this stuff out. And again, this is all just like discovery ideas, planning so far of getting the progress of it. But you could take into Cloud Agents SDK, you could take in the application permit you put together (it's anywhere from 15 to 30 page PDF) and the rejection letter from the city, and then- Instead of having the contractor have to go dive deep into city documents, Cloud Agents SDK uses web search to go and properly finds all the rules for the city and the state, and then basically outlines exactly what the contractor needs to do. That's kind of like prototyping where I'm at, but if you guys were going to put me into the project, I would probably go get- Get it to- I think it can get to the point where we can take the permit as is and then modify the PDFs themselves for the contractor so they can have a finished second version of the corrections flow.

The other route I would rather well, where I really want to take this is so that the cities when contractors submit a permit, rather than having to wait possibly up to 60 days, the city can use our Crossbeam and then immediately be like, "Hey, you messed up these little you kind of screwed up these little small parts, right? You know, the Title 24, the COW green application. Oh, you forgot to sign this thing or you didn't get an engineer thing that will speed up the process a ton. You know, is getting that stuff out. So it's all automated. The beauty of the California, especially the 80% use and a lot of the permitting process by law in California for 80% use these attachable houses. Cities for every permit requirement they have to publish it on their website by law, so Claude Code is actually amazing at going to each city's website and finding the exact regulations they need to know or the contractor needs to know that applies to them. So there's a lot of promise here. I'm stoked about it. It was going to be kind of like a side project that was going to take a while, but if you guys let me in for a hack-a-thon, Here we could definitely with especially with Opus 4.6 is so damn good. We can get it done in a single week.

Great vision and lots of real-world impact. What is your Anthropic API organization UUID? (You’ll find it at console.anthropic.com/settings/organization)
