## **3. Hackathon Rules**

To keep things fair and aligned with our goals, all teams must follow these rules:

- **Open Source:** Everything shown in the demo must be fully open source. This includes every component - backend, frontend, models, and any other parts of the project - published under an approved open source license.

- **New Work Only:** All projects must be started from scratch during the hackathon with no previous work.

- **Team Size:** Teams may have up to **2** members.

- **Banned Projects:** Projects will be disqualified if they: violate legal, ethical, or platform policies, use code, data, or assets you do not have the rights to.

## **4. Problem Statements & Example Projects**

**Problem Statement One:** Build a Tool That Should Exist — Create the AI-native app or workflow you wish someone had already built. Eliminate busywork. Make hard things effortless.

**Example Projects:**

- Contract Lifecycle Autopilot - Extracts all obligations from contracts and tracks deadlines with automatic reminders

- Product Changelog Publisher - Turns release notes into customer-facing announcements across multiple channels

- Bug Report Enricher - Automatically adds system logs, user history, and reproduction steps to support tickets

**Problem Statement Two:** Break the Barriers — Expert knowledge, essential tools, AI's benefits — take something powerful that's locked behind expertise, cost, language, or infrastructure and put it in everyone's hands.

**Example Projects:**

- Crop Doctor — Combines image analysis, weather data, and soil reports to diagnose plant diseases and recommend organic treatment protocols.

- Accessibility Auditor — Evaluates websites, documents, and physical spaces against accessibility standards and generates remediation plans.

- Open Source Hardware Guide — Helps makers navigate component selection, PCB design, and manufacturing for hardware projects.

**Problem Statement Three:** Amplify Human Judgment — Build AI that makes researchers, professionals, and decision-makers dramatically more capable — without taking them out of the loop. The best AI doesn't replace human expertise. It sharpens it.

**Example Projects:**

- Brand Safety Monitor - Reviews ad placements and content adjacencies, flagging reputation risks for marketing teams

- Discovery Anomaly Detector - Flags documents in discovery that should exist but are missing based on references in other documents

- Grading Calibration Partner — Highlights scoring inconsistencies in instructor assessments, supporting but not overriding professional judgment on standards.

## **6. Judging**

Judging for the Anthropic Virtual Hackathon happens in **two stages**:

### **Stage 1 – Asynchronous Judging**

- **Date:** Feb 16th - Feb 17th

- **How it works:**

  - Judges review your **submitted projects asynchronously** via the judging platform.

  - Each team will have uploaded:

    1. A **short demo video** (3 minute maximum)

    2. Open Source Project repository / code

    3. Written summary (100–200 words)

  - Judges independently evaluate projects using **standardized criteria**.\
    **Judging Criteria:**

    1. **Impact (25%) -** What's the real-world potential here? Who benefits, and how much does it matter? Could this actually become something people use? Does it fit into one of the problem statements listed above?

    2. **Opus 4.6 Use (25%) -** How creatively did this team use Opus 4.6? Did they go beyond a basic integration? Did they surface capabilities that surprised even us?

    3. **Depth & Execution (20%) —** Did the team push past their first idea? Is the engineering sound and thoughtfully refined? Does this feel like something that was wrestled with — real craft, not just a quick hack?

    4. **Demo (30%) *—*** Is this a working, impressive demo? Does it hold up live? Is it genuinely cool to watch?

  - After evaluation, the **team aggregates scores** to determine the **Top 6 projects** for the final round

### **Stage 2 – Final Round Live Judging**

- **Date & Time:** Feb 18th, 12:00PM EST

- **Format:**

  - During the live session, **pre-recorded demos** from each team will be played (3 minutes per team).

  - Judges will deliberate after all demos to determine the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place along with extra prizes.

**The top three and special prize winners** will be announced during the closing ceremony at **1:30PM EST.**

## **7. Submission Instructions**

- Submit your project [below](https://cerebralvalley.ai/e/claude-code-hackathon/hackathon/submit)

  [linkEmbed]

- Required for submission:

  - **3-minute demo video** (YouTube, Loom, or similar)

  - **GitHub repository or code link**

  - **Written description / summary**

- **Deadline:** Feb 16th, 3:00 PM EST

- Make sure your project was **built entirely during the hackathon**; no pre-existing work is allowed.

## **8. Prizes**

- **1st Place:** $50,000 in Claude API Credits

- **2nd Place:** $30,000 in Claude API Credits

- **3rd Place:** $10,000 in Claude API Credits

- **Most Creative Opus 4.6 Exploration**: $5,000 in Claude API Credits

  - This prize is for the team that found the most interesting edge of this new model — the unexpected capability or the use case nobody thought to try. We want the project that taught us something new about what Opus 4.6 can do

- **The “Keep Thinking” Prize**: $5,000 in Claude API Credits

  - For the project that didn't stop at the first idea. We're looking for the team that pushed past the obvious, iterated relentlessly, and showed the kind of depth that turns a good hack into something genuinely surprising.
