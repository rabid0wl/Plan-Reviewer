Meeting Title: AI corrections workflow for ADU permit design process
Date: Feb 3

Transcript:
 
Them: I gave him one of our plan sets, and then I gave him a list of corrections from Placentia. So my thinking is like, hey. You know, you as a designer Number one, it seems like the biggest pain point is getting corrections and responding to those corrections. Right? I think if we have all the information synced up within the AI, we can almost systemize any corrections that come back. So I don't know  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: That's that's kinda what we were thinking with this, and and I'm just kinda helping Mike out because I think it could apply to this industry. But I don't know what your thoughts are, Mario, if you wanna chime in. Oh, yeah. I mean, even even before you submit, any plans, like, one of the things that and you probably experience this, Cameron, sometimes some of the cities don't know much about their ADU loss. And so and things that come up are, like, utility easements. Right? Like, that's a big one. A lot of and I always tell Cameron about my horror stories with, Anaheim. There's a lot of things that this this city specifically is very strict about. And the learning curve for me was always doing kind of a prechecklist and talk to planners and, both planners and building in safety. You have to talk to both of them because they're not communicating. So if there's a way, an AI like, if I were to type in an AI and say, hey. What are the give me a checklist of what I need to know about this property, and and what would planning say, or what would, building and safety say? Like, that would be helpful. And then also asking, like, if if there's any utility easements, will the zoning prevent me from being able to you know, you know, cause any delays. Like, this random one that came up from fire, and this is a little separate department too, but they they're big on fire. So, apparently, my because of the awkward actually, so this lot, for example, that I'm working on, it has a unique  
Me: Okay.  
Them: shape. It's in a cul de sac, and it triggered this appendix f that now it's challenging the design, so I have to go back and and redesign it a bit because now there's a setback involved. And I'm encroaching in the set that the city requires. So those kind of things would be really helpful in the very upfront so that  
Me: Okay.  
Them: it streamlines the process afterwards. Now coming back to what Cameron said about the correct like, sometimes they'll ask you to do a a written response of where you put those corrections Like, that would really help AI too. If AI could say, hey. Here's my set of plans. Here's where I put all the corrections. Can you formalize this all in a in a letter for the city?  
Me: Okay. Let's go. So I'm gonna give you guys, like, a little bit of a demo. So this is gonna be, like, the coded  
Them: Sure.  
Me: this is the corrections one on Cameron's. I've already ran it, and then we'll see what you guys think of the output, and then that's where we could tweak. And then I wanna go back to that appendix f, the pre checklist idea. That's where I thought originally I was gonna be doing beforehand. So this is all gonna look like some crazy code stuff. But  
Them: Cameron, what do you what do you think about what I said about the pre  
Me: let me get  
Them: precept? Think it's perfect. And another thing we can do because like Mike said, it's all about the information you feed it. Right? Yeah. So what I'm thinking is we can go through the eight we can feed it the h handbook, which is California wide, and then it can pull data from each city. Right? But I guess my thoughts are right Kinda like you said, Mario, if we have the HCD and where the the code applies or the law law, we can submit all that within our submittals. That way, there's any issues with city or even if the city comes back, we can reference what code it is. You know what I mean? So I think that would be very helpful as well. But sorry, Mike. Yeah. Go ahead.  
Me: Oh, no. I'm just typing in some bullshit. Because this is me kind of, like, so I had a the the one thing, the PDF that you sent me, it, I had to parse it into PNGs. And then I was pretty happy with the stuff. So what it's gonna do is gonna pull out It's gonna go through the whole corrections or the corrections letter. Which I need a reference. Parts. Okay. At second. Review. Reactions. Letter. Let me get the actual Okay. So what I'm doing is I wrote up so it's got some code on, like, AU corrections. It's got the handbook. That Cameron you gave me. And then it's got basically, it's what it we're feeding in right now this would all be coded into, like, a cool platform in theory. But we're feeding it in that PDF Cameron you gave me for this 1232 North Jefferson property. And we're feeding it in the corrections review letter. Right here. And then what's gonna feedback to us in theory is if it does it right, is is like a list of questions that you would answer as the designer. That were basically, like, hey. You need to, like, give us answers to these things. And then after that, it will then it should put output. It it did a good job on the first one. So we'll see. I wanted to see from a qualitative perspective. I can show you the first run. I'll put answered. So gave us a corrections report. This will all look better. It looks like code right now. But so, like, in this one, right, there was, like, things you need to go sign  
Them: So  
Me: written responses resolved, s three.  
Them: Sorry. Are you sharing your screen? Is is it  
Me: Oh, sorry. Yes. It died on you guys. Hold up.  
Them: k. I think it was coming and out. There we go.  
Me: Cool.  
Them: There we go.  
Me: Cool.  
Them: Okay. I'm seeing your your screen.  
Me: So this is cloud code. It's like they just released a UI that that's a little bit easier to understand. But it's it's, like, wildly powerful. This thing is, like, totally the future. It's like that. So it just you send it on these tasks. You you you give it skills of how to do things, and it's just like, right now, it's just reading everything. Right? Complete picture of the plans. Let me create a categorize. Corrections analysis, and output files.  
Them: Okay. So sorry to interrupt and ask you to repeat yourself, Mike. So you basically basically added the PDF  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: of the corrections that Cameron received. And it amortized it, basically.  
Me: So taking the the letter plus the original  
Them: Okay.  
Me: submitted proposal. Right? And then it's gonna do everything everything it can without knowing answers.  
Them: Okay.  
Me: It's gonna, complete the things it can do. Based upon because it's going into the city of placenta and researching what the actual specifications are. Plus, has access to the the it has access So we can look it up online because of the rule in California that you have to publish all your guidelines. And then it has that HDU or HDU PDF guideline guidebook.  
Them: They got they got a lot time.  
Me: Yeah. So it has those So, basically, this gets better the more information you feed it, but the cool thing is because every city is published, it's really good at running sub agents and looking for like, doing the research online of what the actual like, guidelines are.  
Them: Oh,  
Me: So, yeah, now we're getting a, yeah, output second review.  
Them: well, well, and real quick, correct me if I'm wrong, Mario, but most of the times, if there's a correction, it specifies exactly what you need. Right? So, Mike, I guess it could kinda pull the information based off the correction.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Correct?  
Me: Exactly. That's the the ideal goal. Right? Which is I don't know how long that if how useful that is for you. But, you know, you could definitely increase your volume. It's like that. That's what so this is all I can discovery process for me. Seeing what you guys need. But the corrections one, when Cameron was walking me through that and he gave me you know it's basically the raw materials. Know? It's just a letter. From the city, and then here's your original thing. And it's like I was like, oh, yeah. This could do it really quickly. Contractor. Alright. Cool. So now this is where I found it interesting is is is it's gonna give you a series of questions. So it's already done with that. The following information is needed from the contractor to complete the corrections response.  
Them: Oh, I see.  
Me: So item four, documentations of add add a utility adequate suite for the increased plumbing load. What is the size of the existing waste sewer? These things. Was the permanent number of fixtures? Was the  
Them: So so then real quick, Mike, if it doesn't know, it just prompts us to to plug in whatever that is. Right?  
Me: Yeah. So this would be, like, a it would basically be, like, a form that would go up like and then you'd go answer these things. Press enter, and it will complete the form for you.  
Them: I mean, these are these are things that you would have to go on-site and verify just to know what where it's at exactly, and then you come back and input it. Right? That's ideally and just based on what I'm looking at right now and some of these questions,  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Exactly. And I and I don't know how useful it'd be, you know, Mario, that's kinda what me and Mike were just exploring. But, I mean, just tell us your honest thoughts. Like, know, is it useful? I mean, what what else could you see? You know what I mean? No. I mean, that it's it's already a like, for me, you know, I could share a a screen. Right? Really if that's okay and show you some of the the boards that release some of the corrections or at least give you a taste of Anaheim. Right? This their structure Which is one of the worst cities, by the way, Mike, to work with.  
Me: Yeah. That was I was gonna bring it up because, that would be an interesting test case. Then if they're really hard to deal with. So  
Them: So, like,  
Me: question is, like, is there their stuff has to be available online because  
Them: that's the problem, though. Not everything's online. They'll give you the basic and we could literally just go on Anaheim too. Here, look. I'm just sure. Gonna share my entire screen just so you could see it. Their ADU their their trying to push more for their pre, preapproved ADUs just because they've approved it. But the problem is when you try to retrofit their their their ADUs into especially the like, my lot, which is a specific unique lock that has, like, this awkward shape.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: It won't work. You know? It it it it, you know, it steps into especially if you wanna use their 1,200 square foot lot, now you're encroaching into their setbacks. Set. They didn't tell you triggers. So I'll give you a basic. Right? Some of these things, I'll show you the preapproved, junior submittal process, Very basic stuff. This is what their ADU Express is, which is their what they're trying to quote, unquote, if you get a preapproved plan, we'll quickly, address it. So when I look at you know, they have their municipal code here where you're able to look at all the requirements. Great. You know, we talked about that, but it didn't talk about potential properties triggering appendix act  
Me: Okay. So that would be, like, a tricky one if we can get the a out of  
Them: appendix f. Yeah.  
Me: figure that out, which would require it to go look up, through Google Maps has a really good API, so I wonder if we can tie it in there, like, look up the get the property lines, those things.  
Them: And so yeah. No. Definitely. And then you look at some of these, like, codes. It's it's very generic. It's almost, like, similar to what the handbook offers. Now  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: gonna go to Miro because this is where I I kinda have my it's my brain and how I have to, like, read things and and move things. But  
Me: Oh, cool.  
Them: here's the list of other corrections. Now this is this is the appendix f that it triggered. And so where it told me how I need to define my step back, And so if you look at the property, right, these sketches here.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: You know, the property now encroaches within this 25 foot setback, so now it has to be a bit redesigned. So those are the things I would love  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: to have known prior to. You know? And the and, unfortunately, the planners didn't And here's the other thing too. Okay? Keep in mind is that it also depends on the and I don't think this is something AI can fix because it's really within the city system. The they did, like, a pre pre review before even accepting my drawings and yet didn't mention any of this stuff. So those were things that  
Me: Oh, so they didn't even know.  
Them: yeah. Exactly. Anyways but that's it. And so, like, those were the like, this form here too. This wasn't on their ADU form. And in their ADU website and all that stuff. So they sent this to me later. So those would be great if AI would be able to catch these things.  
Me: Yeah. That's interesting.  
Them: So  
Me: This would be a great yeah. Like, so we call it in in programming, call these edge cases. Because the the appendix f Yeah. I wonder what even the code would look like So the AI would have to pick up that it's an unusual looking lot and then look up the cities, like, kind of handling of that.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: You'd be surprised. Sometimes it will surprise you with these things. This one would be tough, though, but it might. Though.  
Them: Oh, I I figured. Yeah. This one would be a tough one because the for the lot lot being unique, and here's the other here's the other turning, factor about the setbacks. Being on-site and looking at property, anything that has a utility utility post, there's clearly an easement there. So I knew this setback.  
Me: Wow.  
Them: But I wasn't aware of this setback down here, and there's no utility easements. And so they provided an SC easement map for me. It's and, again, this is something I had to talk to the planners. And and so forth to get all the information I needed. So there's a 10 foot setback here, then it's six, and then it's six. So those are things you would have not known until you get through planning.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: So  
Me: You wanna  
Them: so if AI could pick up too, that'd be awesome.  
Me: yeah. I write.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Yeah. Because it's never perfect. The goal with these AIs, I would say, is to get you, like, 85% of the man hours you put in. Like, if we can get you there, like, I find a lot of value in that.  
Them: Yeah. 100%.  
Me: A lot of people are looking for, like, oh, we want perfect AI. And I'm like, yeah, it's gonna be  
Them: No. No. No. I  
Me: you still gotta think. You know? You gotta do your thing. But,  
Them: I think my advice would be definitely easement easement utility lines is that would be a big one because that is what triggered a lot of these questions.  
Me: Yep. How do you get the you gotta request that through the city. Those aren't public domain. Right?  
Them: Right. That or  
Me: Or are they?  
Them: like, s s Focal Edison also has their easements, and sometimes the cities don't have access to that.  
Me: Okay.  
Them: So yeah, those and and I,  
Me: That's what's tough.  
Them: I have this driver.  
Me: The AI is so good at if it can get access to it, if it's publicly available,  
Them: I  
Me: it it gets it. Like, it gets things that surprise me. But then when there's not, when it's not in the public domain, it gets that's when it gets tricky.  
Them: So the way about easements was because I talked to a SE, so Cal What's it? One of those electricians I and asked them about these things. And so that's where they were able to tell me, yes. We have our own easements. And so  
Me: Oh, wow.  
Them: when eighties were just starting, a lot of you guess a lot of cities didn't know or or did the planners didn't quite know about those things. So that would be very helpful.  
Me: Okay. Is Edison how do you get Edison's easements?  
Them: That's a great question. I think you gotta re I think you gotta request it because there's there's times, like, where we're bringing in more power right, and they're the only ones that know the information on the load and and all that. So  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: might be one of those ones. Because like you said, it's it's fine. As long as it prompts you that, hey. We need more information on x y zed. You can go ahead and input that information manually. You know what I mean?  
Me: Exactly. Yeah.  
Them: So but but as one like you said, as long as you can get 80% of the work done You're saving a bunch of time. And even then, it's it's telling you, hey. You need to go measure x. You know? Go go find the what size the plumbing pipe is or whatever it is. It just kinda breaks it down for you.  
Me: Yeah. You guys wanna see you guys got ten more minutes?  
Them: So yeah. No. Of course. I'm I'm here.  
Me: I'll show you So, basically, what we just did  
Them: That's that's actually a really good point, Cameron, in regards to presetting AI to say, hey. What are your utilities upfront? You know? Yes. Like, that is a determining factor before it could even move forward. Yeah. Exactly. And then as as you know, we could have certain sessions like, is this just does this require fire review? Right? And then there's a whole list of stuff that it can go through. Because, you know, a lot of them are gonna be the same, Mike. But there's gonna be others that you know, other than a standard ADU, it might need a soils report. It might need solar plans. It might need grading plans. Right? So all this stuff can be kinda add ons. But you can ask you can set the AI up by asking it questions. Right? Is it a hillside structure? Is it a freestanding ADU? All this stuff will get triggered into the AI. You can set that up. You know what I mean? Is it gonna trigger a post? So Exactly. And and that's all public information. You can find by parameters you set with the AI, if that makes sense.  
Me: Yeah. That's the goal. Right? So okay. So what I'm doing is I'm gen I'm having it answer, each of those questions it laid out with just synthetic answers that we can get So here, I'll share screen now. K. So I got, like, faux answers. They're not real, obviously, but and then this would be the idea is after you go answer those questions, Then in the back end, you would so you'd answer them, you'd submit them, and then it'll create your whole package back to you. Where is the  
Them: Wow.  
Me: okay. Add contractor. Output second.  
Them: Output  
Me: U slash Okay. Complete the packet with the answers given by in the contractor answers. Thank you. Alright. So now, basically, it'll go in and let's see what it it outputs now. But it's basically gonna take we gave it so I had to just create synthetic answers right here. So three quarter meter, the existing water meter, three quarter copper type l, And so we'll see what it says now.  
Them: Nice.  
Me: Update the response letter. Documents is complete. So the idea the other thing so when when you guys go submit these these answers, are you, like, resubmitting the whole permit with the corrections in it, or are you guys us creating amendments to it?  
Them: Typically, when I draw, when you when you do when you have to redraw everything or at least revise the drawings, you have to put a delta cloud associated with it.  
Me: Okay.  
Them: So  
Me: We already explained that. So Delta Lab is, like, a differential?  
Them: yeah,  
Me: Or yeah. Let me  
Them: Yeah. Can you show him an example, Mario? Sure. Let me pull one in.  
Me: yeah. We'll come back to this when it's you stop.  
Them: Kevin, this is the plans that you saw last time. Bert England? Yeah. For Englewood. Perfect. Okay. So you see this little here?  
Me: Okay.  
Them: And then because this was revision two,  
Me: Interesting. So you put that cloud around it, and it's like, okay. This was what changed.  
Them: It's basically with the response that you have and then you associate that response with the page. And then, obviously, this is kind of an  
Me: Okay.  
Them: indicator of where that correction was revised. So, like, these were notes  
Me: Okay. So there's response letter, and then it states where it is. And then just go into your original plan. Create the revision with the cloud.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Oh, it's interesting. Okay. Cool.  
Them: No. Sometimes the the whole, the whole page needs a huge revisions. Here's another example. Right? I had to revise these little comments that they wanted. But there's one where I did the whole if if it's the whole page, then I just put you know, the whole I just highlight the whole page on that error. So, yeah, that's basically it to answer your question.  
Me: Okay. That cloud, is it, that's just  
Them: Question. Yes.  
Me: software is this right here? Review?  
Them: I'm using a Bluebeam.  
Me: Oh, BlueBeam. Okay.  
Them: Yes. It's a p program.  
Me: Okay. Sweet. And then what how do you create that little cloud thing? Wonder if I get the AI.  
Them: Oh, it's it's in it's in a Revit I use a Revit drafting. This is your BIM model?  
Me: Okay.  
Them: Where where I  
Me: Interesting. Okay. And then is that, like, a  
Them: and so that's where I create the cloud.  
Me: standardized cloud thing, like, design asset? Or  
Them: Ideally, yes.  
Me: okay. Yeah. I gotcha. Okay. Because the question to me is, like, k. Yeah. So just created the let's see here. Corrections report, response letter, draft, And then so is it valuable enough for just the AI creating the response letter draft? Or would you want it to even go further and then do the PDF changes for you?  
Them: Well, when you say PDF, do they actually redraw it too? Or  
Me: It could, technically. That would be harder, but like,  
Them: I mean, if it did it, yeah, it'd be great. But I think with that,  
Me: so  
Them: where it's at in this staging, in this level, I think  
Me: Probably  
Them: if I if it was me right, I just tell me the response. And I'll just go in and manually put it and replot everything.  
Me: Okay. Yeah. So, like, let's say you got this letter right here. So  
Them: So if you're  
Me: included this middle. Okay. So, so this would be the way you'd send to the city.  
Them: Right.  
Me: Okay. And then let's see if we got anything useful here. So it says responsible corrections. All so this is all just saying it's all there. Then we got designer west signatures,  
Them: Maybe if AI tells you hey. Make sure you cloud this on every note. You know? That would  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: probably be helpful, and then I use that as a reference. But  
Me: Critical. Okay. So it gives you a report Okay. So response professional scope, what is this? There's a second review. Acquired actions. So to give you this right here, would would this be useful? Well, this is just this is an easy one.  
Them: Yeah. Yeah. This would be good.  
Me: Okay. So sheet a three roof plan.  
Them: Review of plan orientation. Yeah. I mean, it's telling you what to do, so that's that's helpful. I think it's just a let AI tell us, okay, Where do we need to put the Revision Cloud and the delta?  
Me: Okay. Does it do this right here? Do we need more detail?  
Them: You know?  
Me: Okay. The revision cloud. We need more detail, right, to know exactly where to place it on sheet a three.  
Them: Yeah. So I don't know on the south calling out fire rated soft. Okay. Great. So we'll just put a note there. So that's indicating there. And then add a note on the site plan showing. Greater set of condition, reference new detail number. Okay. So those yeah. So those are instruct for me to go in there and manually put it. So then since I'm already doing that, it's like I have to remember to put a delta over indicating where that new location is. So maybe, know, having AI just say, as a reminder, any new revisions, just cloud it and put a delta associated with it.  
Me: Okay. What about so what about, like, an intermediate step where this sheet corresponds to because we could basically take so a three, I think, would be is that this page? No. Eight three would be s table What the fuck is eight three?  
Them: If you use it now, it should be on the bottom right. It tells you what the number is of the  
Me: Oh, cool.  
Them: so that's a  
Me: Eight one oh, eight two.  
Them: yeah. You gotta look for the right page. A so that's a one.  
Me: That's right here. Okay. So on okay. So this would be a three. And then okay. So page seven, and then would be and then so we're saying the special scope. Okay. So it was saying new detail of this thing right here. Add note on south elevation. How about that five the five foot setback condition on-site plan right there. And then if we go to page seven, Okay. So where would you put that cloud map in? Right here for  
Them: Oh, but it's not it's not it's not showing me a site plan. So  
Me: oh, so got that wrong.  
Them: yeah.  
Me: Okay. So, yeah, it would need to get okay. We need to get better with that. That's not the site plan. Okay.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: What should report a three sheet a three.  
Them: Cite find showing as if yeah.  
Me: So Existing detail two slash a three. Okay. And 14. Cover sheet I'm nine. One d. Okay. So, yeah, that's where because I'm gonna dial in all this stuff. But yeah. Wait. So what plan what sheet would this be? So not a three. What would we be looking at? Here. I'll just bring up  
Them: Try are either a one or a two? Because, typically, the site plan should be in the beginning  
Me: Okay.  
Them: few papers. So a one. Try a one. I think it stopped sharing. Yeah.  
Me: Oh, shit.  
Them: I think Cameron got logged out too.  
Me: If you gotta head out, know we only said only 30. This is super interesting, Because I could get these things pretty dialed in. So is this, the site plan right here?  
Them: You you one more page a one? Sorry to interrupt. Do a.  
Me: Oh, yeah. Yeah.  
Them: So this is your site plan.  
Me: Oh, this is the site plan. Okay. This will be a one.  
Them: It's showing existing in you. So, yeah, this would be a one  
Me: Okay. I could see how I could get that wrong.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: I just gotta be stricter with how to break it down. On that. Interesting. Okay. So this would be and then right here, would have somewhere on here, you'd have a note We could stamp on topping like fire plan. Or five foot setback for fire plan. And then reference the  
Them: Well, ideally, you go back,  
Me: okay.  
Them: ideally, if I were to revise it, yes, you're right. You would put a note here, but you put it as a callout. That's how I would put it. Like, if you zoom in I don't know if you can zoom in,  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: basically, as you can see, the little, it has a little leader line.  
Me: Okay.  
Them: That's how you would make some call outs And then and then from there, I would go ahead and cloud that area.  
Me: Interesting. Okay. Gotcha. Okay.  
Them: So it's it's a little bit  
Me: Yeah. So  
Them: that's why I'm saying this portion might be a little bit more of a, like, still human interaction where they have to control it versus AI stepping in and do  
Me: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No. No. That makes sense.  
Them: portion. Because it might not be there yet.  
Me: Yeah. Because the question to me becomes, with the AIs just confusing, itself because it should know this a one. I'm disappointed and get that part. They're on the site plan. It did say the site plan. That actually indicates to me that it got messed up on its context. Because, see, if we look on here, it's saying nope. Is that Cameron? Admit him. Yeah.  
Them: But it it I mean, it does say plan node but, yeah, it's like, no add note on-site plan. But, yeah, that's not I I think what's it might be confusing it is the floor plan is there, but there's no site so it's like, it's not showing you the context of the site, though.  
Me: Okay. Okay. Gotcha. Let's check out, cover sheet details title 24, sheets notations. Items four and eleven. Add to sheet a one. So these would be the sewer stuff. Would that go into that a one page? That we talk talk about? So a one being this page, And then sorry. I'm having to hop back and forth between  
Them: No worries.  
Me: I wish I could do multi things. So these things, would that traditionally go into sheet way one? Utility connection?  
Them: Yeah. I mean, I would I would do it. I would put that in the line diagram. So, yes, I would I would do it in there. Yes.  
Me: Okay. Okay. Okay. So we got something there.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Okay. Well, I save some signatures that just  
Them: You have stamp your drawings, get a structure with or, an are architect engineer, whoever they they need you to assign off on.  
Me: Oh, yes. So all this stuff is structural engineer stuff you'd need to get. Right here.  
Them: Yeah. So they would be revising that  
Me: I have screw connection. Would this stuff be useful too? Like, just in the sense of what you send off to what your engineers need or they already know all this shit?  
Them: That's a good question. I mean, if it's if it's part of the comments, right, from the the city, then they'll have that point of reference. And if they see what AI is saying, then, yeah, I'll probably help them out. But I think since their, liabilt liability is a lot greater because they are the ones stamping the drawings, at least in my situation, my my engineer stands for my drawings. They'll probably triple check and double check everything.  
Me: Oh, yeah. Yeah. I would always say, yeah, that's where  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: even with the lawyers, I'm like, hey, man. Like, the AI can do a lot of the work, but you you gotta read it. Like,  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: like, it's it's not negligent to use good tools that make you faster, more effective, better for your clients.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: It's negligent to to just trust the tool and send it. You know? You gotta where you still that's where when people are like, oh, it's gonna take our jobs. It's like, no. It's just gonna make us better. If you're good at your job,  
Them: Totally.  
Me: you're gonna get better at it. Like, so But, yeah, that's where it's tough.  
Them: Totally.  
Me: This area. So it's easy in the legal world because I already know what a good demand letter looks like. I know what, like, things you need to do. So I have, like, that domain knowledge. It's so good. I really appreciate this from both you guys, like, through this. Because right now, don't even know if we're gonna do this, but like, the same time, like, hearing this, it's like, oh, there is something here. So  
Them: Well well, I guess, I I I guess I'd wanna hear from Mario. I mean, you know, from your perspective, do you think designers would use this service if it was, you know, fine tuned and kinda helped. I mean, would you pay for a service like that that's reasonably priced? I probably would. Yeah. I think for for someone in my position, right, like, it's just me. And once in a while, I'll hire out. With you know, with drafters. And so you know, sometimes we don't know an answer on the thing, so this would help a lot for smaller teams. So, yeah, I would I would consider it. Now for bigger, large companies, they basically have designated people Right? They have designated people that only do corrections, specifications, and all that. So but I can see that's still being helpful for a helpful tool with them and just streamline. So  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: yeah, this is great. I I would love to see it for sure do a prechecked list. On everything. Like, if he's, like, just what does what is the city just be blunt. What does the city need? And have those questions already in mind. I would still go and talk to the planner. Just to make sure I have those questions and answers kind of already in my mind. Because then I'm able to push and pull with the with the planner. But, yeah, that would be really cool too. So the corrections is great. I think that's wonderful. It could definitely go somewhere. And if there's a prechecklist prior, that would be great. And I think that would help AI, at least with the program that you're giving because you're already feeding it the knowledge of front and then knowing what to expect with whatever the outcome is from the city.  
Me: Yeah. That was fascinating too. I haven't thought through that. The  
Them: Sector.  
Me: prechecklist, Not that hard. The the tough part with these software ones is you kinda usually wanna do one thing really well.  
Them: Oh, yeah. It's cooling.  
Me: And then that's helps with marketing. You know, the second you say you do different things is, like, people are like, why would I pay like, I don't even know what it is. You know? Whereas, like,  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: it's nice to be able to be like, hey. Got a corrections letter on your EDU in California. Like, put it through this software, spend some money, then it'll tell you exactly what to do. Hopefully. You know? Okay. From  
Them: That's great.  
Me: so but the checklist isn't that hard, though. So it could be just a little add on feature. And it makes a lot of sense. Yeah. I'd be interested. I can probably send it and be like, hey, Anna. Anaheim. This person doing it. Get a list of questions for the person. You can answer. Then it basically will just create your your checklist. That wouldn't be that hard. Okay. So from okay. I think I'm gonna run it through one more time just with a little bit computing horsepower because I did this one quick. And then mind if I send you its output and then you see are you working on this specific project with with Cameron?  
Them: No. I think that's his other grasp. Yeah. Yeah. That's a great different one. Yeah. Yeah.  
Me: Okay. Do you guys have, a project right now in corrections? Like a permit?  
Them: Not yet.  
Me: Okay.  
Them: I I could always take a look at what what if you're okay with that camera, I could always take a look at it. But or if you want the guy in front that you work with too. Yeah. I mean, what whatever, man. I mean, even if you have one coming up, you know, we can we can use that.  
Me: Yeah. If you got any Mario, if you have one out, a permit out, and then with a corrections letter, I would love to run it through send you its output, or send you the questions with the output. You send me answers back to the questions. Run it through, and then because that would be the best way for us to see, like, how accurate this thing is. Because then you'd be doing it anyways. You're like, oh, yeah. No. It was bullshit or whatever. The other route we can go, Cameron, is if you guys have any projects where, you send a permit in, you got a corrections letter, you guys manually already got it corrected and the city approved. I could take that as all just training data. You know, to show the whole process. That also could work too. But doing it live is the best way to do it. That's what I found.  
Them: Okay. Willis let's let's wait for let's wait for Mario to get a round of  
Me: Like, with my software,  
Them: corrections back or whenever you're submitting one, and then that way we can kinda follow it all along.  
Me: I know. It'd be cool. Right?  
Them: You know? Yeah. That's that's what I think is best. I have I have this one. I'm gonna pull it up. This one's not too bad. There is minor corrections on this one, and this is from customization.  
Me: Oh, cool.  
Them: So as you can see, it's just, like, fairly basic stuff that I need to address so I could send them over to you. Most of it was all struck anyways, so I could send it your way if you want.  
Me: Dude, I'd love that. That plus the letter, and then I'll have it output what it  
Them: And this  
Me: the questions, and then just get back to me with those answers.  
Them: Just get on. It's Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  
Me: Be killer. We could see where a good news not give us a SaaS support.  
Them: Okay.  
Me: Then I could go tidy it up, make it and then, basically, through by doing it, repetition, you just make these things a lot better.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: So  
Them: Now I am working on another project in Cypress. This one's Cameron, this is what's his name? Oh my god. I'm blinking out. It's Robert where I'm Oh, yeah. Yeah. Robert Hernandez. So I'm looking at I just wanna talk to zoning prior, but again, Mike, I don't know if you wanna take this extent, but it would be, like, great. I already have the design kind of ideally ready. I was gonna talk to planners just to make sure everything's good. You wanted to do kinda, like, a prechecklist,  
Me: Yeah. Let's do that one too. Yeah. Alright. So send that one over. Give me and just make sure they're, they're marked. Like, this is the one with the corrections letter.  
Them: Okay.  
Me: Guess I can figure that out with Costa Mesa. And then the pre checklist because I actually  
Them: Okay.  
Me: actually do have a program written for that one, but I have but I didn't really have anything to test that against. And then what I really like is the the questions it would ask you to get further context. Originally, was thinking of it as, like, it just creates the PDF. You know?  
Them: Okay.  
Me: That you submit, but I like better this route right here.  
Them: Okay.  
Me: You're talking about let's try both out. Yeah. I'll get back to you.  
Them: Cool. Alright. Awesome.  
Me: Alright, guys. I appreciate it a lot.  
Them: Cool, guys. Well, thanks for hopping on, Mario. I I appreciate it. I know, kind of a new concept, but I I when Mike was talking, I'm like, dude, you you could probably do something with with designers. You know? It saves so much time. It allows me to lead gen more on more projects versus, just Yeah. On the Well, because most most most people are just a a one man show. You know what I mean? I mean, it's unless you're doing big skyscrapers and shit. I mean, most people are just a team of one to five. You know? Well, the other thing too is, like, you're chasing after, planners just to get back to you on certain questions. Like Hundred percent. Yeah. Get those answers right away. Helps. Yeah. 100%. And what's nice too is, like, like I said, if if long as you have the HCD guideline, there's even there's even, things you can do where if the planner says a contradictory comment, it can pull up the data from HCD and say, hey. You're you're within violation of second code blah blah blah per state law. You know, mean? I mean, there's all there's a bunch of shit you could do with it because, Mike, that is common. I mean, you'll talk to a planner who has no idea what they're talking about.  
Me: Yeah. I imagine.  
Them: Correct. And you almost have to go reference what the state code is.  
Me: Yeah. That's interesting.  
Them: Know what I mean? So the there's a bunch of stuff you could go.  
Me: Well, no. No. It's fascinating. And then, Cameron, you know, I got my buddies, my buddies, Maribuana Park. And then so  
Them: Yes. Exactly.  
Me: kinda like, you know, it's an offshoot possibility, be interesting to see if we can get this working right here, then instead of just going to designers, go to the city, cities pay for it, for designers to submit, so then they could speed up the whole process. It could be interesting.  
Them: 100%. 100%.  
Me: So  
Them: Yeah. I I think that's a whole another avenue too. I mean, don't you think, Mario? Because the planners are kinda disorganized. Yeah. Definitely. So  
Me: Sounds like there's a constant backlog, and the city the state and cities are kind of, like, they're pressing we need more housing. So could  
Them: there there is. It it is, Mike. It's when, when, basically, the state said hey. We're gonna prove ADUs. Alright. Here you go, cities. And cities only have, like, for example, it's funny, Cerritos. They only have, like, one plant  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: and they're taking care of the whole the whole, city. And so you could even people wanting to do ADUs, so they're all tossing these, you know, backlogs where they have to now go third party, and the third parties are also trying to figure it out. So it it causes this weird ripple effect.  
Me: Yeah. No. I hear you guys. No. It's crazy. I couldn't believe when Cameron showed me the original plan. I was like, man, this is so dense. This is, like, really, really dense shit. So alright, boys. Well, appreciate it. Alright. Mario, send over those materials, and then I'll send you start with the correction one because I already kinda got that done, and then I'll see what the  
Them: K.  
Me: the pre checklist looks like. And then just be honest, you know, because then I'll take your emails or we can hop on another call, and then I'll take the transcript from the call. And then, basically, have the AI make itself better. So  
Them: Okay. Okay.  
Me: cool.  
Them: If if you're okay, I got some things to do today, but I'll it to you, end of day tomorrow. That's a  
Me: Oh, yeah. No rush. Yeah. Awesome, man. Thanks, guys. See you later.  
Them: Sorry. Guys. Thank you. Thank you, guys. See you.  
Me: Later.  
Them: Bye.
