Meeting Title: ADU Permit Process and AI Automation Exploration
Date: Jan 30

Transcript:
 
Them: Hey. You know, any aid you that's freestanding in California that's over 500 square feet, it's gonna trigger solar panels. So that's gonna be a requirement. It's also gonna trigger a SOUL's test from a SOUL's engineer. So little stuff like that, can put in a template to where it's like, okay. Cool. Here's our scope of work. You click, you know, here's our square footage. Is it gonna is it gonna require fire review? No. If it requires fire review, how much bullshit do we have to go through  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: to review the fire? Right? Can we upload documents there? So do I think there's a market? Yes. I just I don't think as far as me talking about it, I don't do the submittals, but I can definitely have someone who does the submittals talk to you about it. That way you can brainstorm because, dude,  
Me: Yeah. So how's that work? You know? Like or so yeah. Talk to me about, like because ways of what you'd be doing is you're hiring you're already hiring someone to do that process. Right?  
Them: Yeah. Because it it is a pain in the butt.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: And here's the thing. Like, you can systemize it as much as possible, but there's always gonna be cities that require different things, and they'll come back with corrections. Right?  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: So it depends. For me, it's more of a specialty because usually the designer on record who's doing the design for it, who, again, that's a third party. We sub it out. Even the one guy that I work with, but those are usually the people that submit because those are the people that are to talking to the city, knowing what they want. Because the process, just so you know, is this. Like, ADUI is very similar like building anything. You submit a plan, set to the planning department. There's a certain set of guidelines that they review. For example, code stuff, square footage,  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: you know, are you within the floor area ratio of the lot? Just simple things that are easy checklist. From there, once planning approves, it goes to building. Once, and by the way, planning could be a back and forth so that you could submit, and then there's, like, a sixty day review time. And then who knows? They could say, hey. We wanna know about more about your condenser for your mini splinter. We wanna know about this. Or  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: can you specify this? Right? So there's always back and forth. But after the planning, it goes to building. The building department is really more of the nuts and bolts of it. Where that's always gonna be different. Right? And the reason why is that's more of the engineering calculations. So that portion's probably not as, you know, automated as more of the design portion, if that  
Me: Yeah. That was the one yeah. Because building is, like, the the way load bearing of the roof. Right?  
Them: Yeah. All that. Yeah. And it's gonna be numbers and calculations.  
Me: It's Yeah. It's like actual calculations. Yeah.  
Them: Yeah. So  
Me: Was that yeah. That one was the AI was saying it like, yeah. We can't do this yet legally and mathematically. It's like you need, like, an act  
Them: Yes.  
Me: actual engineer. I but that that's kinda funny. They actually will figure that one out, but  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: that's separate than what I would be what I was thinking about doing here.  
Them: Yeah. Yeah.  
Me: No. They do. That's fucking rad. Yeah. What got me pumped about this was it was I realized there's a California law that when you have for cities to have permits, they have to publish how to  
Them: Yep.  
Me: get passed through your perimeter system. I was like, oh, shit. So the AI can we we can just use they're getting really good at web scraping and going through, and finding this  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: because I've seen it in the law side. And, so just to get it to go through and then basically get every city. So you're like, you know, Long Beach is easy, like, know, if you're doing fucking Buena Park or whatever, you know, It's like it's already there. So the thing knows how to go out there, go get the rules,  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: figure out what the subtleties are, and then guide you through the process and fill and then my software already knows how to fill out forms. Pretty good.  
Them: Yeah. Yep.  
Me: But like, my thing so, like, in the legal world, like, everyone has per client, per like, case matter. You have, like, like, a client file. Right? It gets really unorganized, but you kinda just have a place. So, like, what people liked from my demand letter thing was you could just drag and drop the file onto the thing, and then the AI would kinda handle from there. And it wouldn't be perfect, but it'll get you, like, 90% of work done was the goal. You know? And then you obviously still have to go check your shit. You can't just, like, let AI do it. That's just negligent for everyone involved.  
Them: Yeah. Yep.  
Me: But it saves you a ton of time. You know? So that was like what is that? Like, when you're doing this process, so you what do you pass to your person? That does the submittals and everything?  
Them: Yeah. So, so here's what I here's, like, my process. Right? I have I have an ADU in so first off, I charge everybody $300 to go on-site. Right? So I'll tell them about, you know, what they can build, average cost, When I go out there, do a site inspection. It's a full PDF of, like, measurements, pictures, notes. Then I do, like, a preliminary plot map it's gonna be, like, a satellite picture of their house with, like, one of our eight years just  
Me: Okay.  
Them: kinda see how it lays out on a satellite. And then I'd  
Me: Wait. So you're talking about you go to the person's house. This is, like, someone coming to you and be like, hey. I wanna build an ADU.  
Them: yeah.  
Me: You go set then you go get you go get the measurements. You send someone out there to get measurements.  
Them: I I I do that first. Right? So I go out there at first,  
Me: Oh, yeah.  
Them: and then that's why I charge because, like, it's just weeding out the people that are serious. You know I mean?  
Me: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Totally. No. Agreed.  
Them: So so I go out there, and I provide them those three documents. So it's a proposal and an  
Me: Okay.  
Them: inspection report, and then that, like, preliminary plot map. And then from there, I'll send them a a design build proposal with those documents. And then when they sign on board, the first step we do is, like, I'll have my design team, right, which is a third party sub. I have them go out once we sign, They'll do laser measurements on-site, and they'll actually create a custom plan for them.  
Me: Okay. This is now.  
Them: When they create yeah.  
Me: With laser measurements and those things. Okay. Gotcha.  
Them: Yep. And based off those measurements, all that all the shit I sent you as far as that p d that PDF file, like,  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: plan set, a lot of that shit's plugged in there from you know, most of those a lot of those pages minus the the engineering portion.  
Me: Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. That which is like  
Them: Right?  
Me: yeah. Because it was like I was like I think the first six pages or whatever were engineering happened. Yeah. At some some certain page, the AI was like, alright. This is engineering now. That's build. Right?  
Them: Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. But but even on, like so for example,  
Me: Yep.  
Them: on construction documents, right, you have details, which is basically a detail showing you, like, how a wall is connected to a roof. Right?  
Me: Yeah. Yeah.  
Them: So there's all these different details, and those templates can be kinda universal. Right? So  
Me: Okay.  
Them: like, what I'm thinking is you can come up in a way where like I said, it's not gonna be exact, but at least the planning portion, you can be like, hey. If we have as long as we have how many windows, you know, electrical, square footage, how many bathrooms, and you can feed it the information. It can spit out a fuck  
Me: Oh, yeah. It's early.  
Them: planning submittal right away. You know?  
Me: Now but where is the raw data that that would that that's what I've been trying to figure out is, like, where is where is your guys client file? Or do you guys like, what is so you gave those thing that you give them, like, a submittal from the satellites. Right? Then there's an actual design team that goes and gets the exact measurements.  
Them: Yep.  
Me: And then they kinda the design team is the one with, like, the raw kind of stuff that they then have to they probably already have some softwares.  
Them: Yeah. They do. So they use, like,  
Me: But  
Them: different CAD softwares, and then I don't know what software they use for all those templates.  
Me: yeah.  
Them: Because like I said, a lot of the the the shit you see in those pages, obviously, you're gonna change some.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: But a lot of it's, like, just repetitive code that you have to put in there. You know?  
Me: Yeah. Well, yeah, yeah.  
Them: So so I and that's the thing. I what I'd love to do because here's the thing. I think there's something here, whether it's for designers or people submitting or even on the city  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: side, dude. Because here's the thing, bro. Like, the city software, every time you go to a city, I deal with them all the time. The software is from, like, 1999. It's so fucking outdated and so ridiculous. But here's the thing. That's why it takes so long for these people to review this bullshit. You know what I mean?  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: And, like, look, the biggest pain point with housing right now is how fast people can get approvals. If you have one guy that's reviewing all files and he's gotta manually review all this shit, like, the robots can do more than 70% of it. You know what I mean?  
Me: Oh, yeah. Yeah. A 100%. Yeah. Yeah. That's what that's what I'm talking to. You you sparked  
Them: So yeah.  
Me: an idea, so I'm talking to Connor about it for Buena Park. You know? And then so he does he was like, yeah. I don't even know. He just knows their backlog.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: I was like, alright. Cool. We could do something here.  
Them: Yeah. And and there's ways you can build an and, again, I'm a software guy, so I don't know how that works. And but both, like I said, on the user side of, like, an average user who's not a designer to get a design packers ready for the planning department, you can make money off of that. You know?  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: And then, obviously, you still need the engineer to sign off anyways, so you just have them do the the engineering. You know?  
Me: Yeah. What's your like, what's your when you go to the when someone pays you $300 to go to the site, what's and you give them those three PDFs. What like, what do you use to make that? That's kinda okay.  
Them: Pulse safety culture, it's an app. So, I made my own, like, inspection template out of there. And so it's specifically for aid use. And and I basically, on-site, kinda  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: take it sells me, like, take photos of all, you know, four sides, and then I made that template.  
Me: Oh, it's not m.  
Them: So it's very, like, informative for them. It helps me bid because I know  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: everything. You know what I mean? And then from there, I feed everything. Like, when I send the client a proposal, I use a really cool software called Buildertrend.  
Me: K. Builder  
Them: And so everything as far as, like, you're saying the client information, all that, it's all within builder trends. So address, email, phone,  
Me: Okay.  
Them: anything we need to know with the job, square footage, like, where the lead came from, all that shit. What the projected revenue is, like, all that stuff is marked down in builder trend.  
Me: And people you people like you and Bryce use all all use Buildertrend. Right?  
Them: I do. Yeah. A lot of them do. And it just because, like, dude, I'm running, like, 20 jobs  
Me: Like a pop Yeah. Totally.  
Them: so it's just there's no way I could if it if it wasn't for self.  
Me: Yes. So Buildertrend, is there a way to export that data from Buildertrend per job?  
Them: Yeah. Yeah.  
Me: Yeah. Can you pass me that for, like, an upcoming project or that Long Beach 20 you did? Because what I'd be interested in is so what I love doing is taking unstructured data like data dumps, just feeding it to the AI. The AI comes back to you with some questions. You answer the questions real quick.  
Them: Mhmm. Mhmm.  
Me: And then and then boom. Everything's done. It just tells you, hey. I don't have this information, so fill this shit out yourself. You know? And it's like,  
Them: Yeah. So you want me to get you, like, like, a data from, like, like, pretty much like a a a some sort of data sheet  
Me: Yeah. Yeah.  
Them: for the information on a client. Yeah.  
Me: You know, it would be a cool one with that, that finished the project you sent me, the Long Beach one.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: That would be really cool because it's almost like a math equation because it's like, okay. Here's where it was in builder trend, and here's where it is when it finished from the  
Them: Mhmm.  
Me: from the proposal. Right? And then whereas, and then also just a raw one that's, like, in process would be sick too. Then I can see what what we can do with the AI from a proposal or, I mean, from a planning per not planning, permit perspective. You know?  
Them: Yeah. So and, honestly, what I here's what I think's best. I think you should talk to one of my buddies, Mario. Who does he does a lot of planning. And  
Me: Okay.  
Them: and he's he's a pretty good connection because he actually also teaches at Long Beach State. But I because here's the thing. It's more of a planning planning thing, right, for, like, a designer. So because I don't do them. I know how to do them. It's just I don't deal deal with them all the time, so I don't really know, like, the pain points and what  
Me: Okay. They're the ones.  
Them: sections. Why don't I connect you with Mario and then he can run through a file with you. I can even go to lunch with you  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: or whatever, but he'd be a really good guy for you to talk to since he's doing it every day. You know what I mean?  
Me: Alright. That's cool because he's filling out these permits per city.  
Them: Yeah. Yeah. Exactly.  
Me: Okay.  
Them: And he's the one going to the city, and and he's he's really good he's a really good contacts. But I'd I'd like for you to talk to him. Because like I said, he's gonna know what he needs help with better. You know? And he's gonna know what the CDs need and and, basically, what you can  
Me: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  
Them: change and what you can't. You know?  
Me: Yeah. What's interesting? Yeah. Yeah. No. That would be a good guy to talk to. What's interesting is the question is, like, is he the market, or is he the guy getting replaced? You know? Like, it would be good to help him, but then the problem is, like, with these AIs, some people get defensive. So I I be game to talk to them regardless. But  
Them: Well, but but here but here's the thing. I don't think  
Me: and here  
Them: because look. Regardless of whether AR or not, people don't wanna go to the city. They don't wanna deal Regardless of AI, we're still gonna need to do a custom design, and they're still gonna want that people to people. Right?  
Me: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Sure.  
Them: It just it just load it just lessens his workload.  
Me: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  
Them: So I I think, realistically, it's it's not gonna be an end user thing. I think just like Buildertrend is, you know,  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: their target markets builders. Right? I think if you were to do this, it would be  
Me: Oh, interesting. Okay. Yeah.  
Them: designers or planners or certain people that submit plan.  
Me: Because his job isn't to  
Them: You know?  
Me: build permits or make permits. His job is to design and yes and know how the permits work.  
Them: That's correct. Yeah. His job is to basically submit the permit files and then basically get whatever the city's at is asking him. Right?  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: And then, again, there's a basic we know there's a basic set of rules for every city. Right? And what's nice what they'd use, it's  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: statewide, there's one set of rules. It's not like I mean, there's certain little nuances per city, which we we can go ahead and change, but there's one fucking statewide for every city.  
Me: Yeah. That's what that's what I want the raw data because I've already got that one. Not necessarily perfect, but I've already got that programmed.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: The AI is, like, ready to go for the state. Then the city one is what's interesting to me because it goes Esko dynamically, figure out what every cities is. So  
Them: So  
Me: that's like a stack AI that does that part.  
Them: yeah. And I'll send you there's an eight it's called the HCD ADU handbook. That's literally all the rules and everything you need to know for building ADUs. It's like the bible.  
Me: HCD, a d u.  
Them: Yeah. I'll I'll I have the handbook right here. I'm gonna I'm gonna email it to you.  
Me: I said say  
Them: But here's what you wanna do. You wanna upload that handbook because it's the I all updated. And then you wanna talk to Mario. And then because  
Me: sorry. Yeah. You can intro us, that'd awesome, dude.  
Them: yeah. Yeah. And I'll call Mario too. But, yeah, I think that would be a good step because like I said, when you were talking about what you're doing, I'm like because, dude, I'm I'm a big believer in, like, out pain points and how to make things more efficient, which AI does. And like I said, both on the submittal side, on the design side, and the city side. So I think starting on the designer side, it's good to know the pain points.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: And then later on, you can maybe go try to do something with the cities. Because the cities, bro, they need help too.  
Me: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Now the city yeah. The city is really interesting because you're dealing with like because I could take I was kinda returning reverse engineer your proposal and then, like, you could pretty simply like, the city has their published guidelines, and then it's, like, okay. Because yours was good, but, like, in theory, you could have the AI just be like,  
Them: Yep.  
Me: Kate's missing this. It's doing that or whatever. Give, like, that initial email out, like, hey. We need this info or something like that.  
Them: Yep.  
Me: You could have the AI kinda handle that stuff. The other thing the AI would be really good at is when the city comes back to you for the first time, and says, hey. We need these things. And then it could look at your current proposal plus the letter and then suggest fixes based upon what it knows about project versus also telling you what you need to go fill out. You know? So  
Them: That's yeah. That'd be great. And and so it almost, like, just basically puts it like, hey. You need to correct, you know, this, this, this.  
Me: Yeah. Because I don't know what those letters look like, I know what they're probably giving you, like, city guidelines. Right? Like like, here's this this rule. You need this. And then those are probably hard to read because that's legal speak. But then the AI would be good at looking that shit up, figuring out what it is, looking at a deep proposal you did and figuring out what you did wrong.  
Them: Yep. And then I'll show you, like so this let me share my screen because I'll show you  
Me: Yeah. Please  
Them: And, again, this is, like this is the designer that does this. So I'm not really I just kinda, like, look at what's going on. You know what I mean? But this was a correction from the city of  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Placentia and this has been our, like, fucking second or third round, bro. Right? So we submitted our plans. It says, you know, instruction information for the next plan review. Please resubmit complete sets of heart copy plan plans and supporting documents, response to the comment list, of the city of Placentia. So pretty much here, what we what we do  
Me: Yeah. Oh, this is perfect, dude.  
Them: it it shows the comments. So you it could yeah. So it goes through here. And then, look, second review comments. And then it shows add this to governing codes on the cover sheet. Right? So it's gonna specify what sheet, right,  
Me: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  
Them: And so your AI can kinda go through and just fucking do that automatically. And if and if it if it doesn't know the answer, you can prompt it to, hey. You know, what do you input here? You know what I mean?  
Me: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You wanna you wanna try it right now?  
Them: Sure. I can send you this.  
Me: Yeah. Email me this and and the plan and the submitted plan. This is actually a perfect example.  
Them: Okay. Let me send you and that's I'm gonna send you the same email Let me  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: let me send this real quick.  
Me: Sick.  
Them: Yeah. But but but, dude, if if if you can figure something this out because look, the design  
Me: Yeah. If you got yeah. Just take it.  
Them: and the cities, like, it's always a back and forth.  
Me: There you go.  
Them: And sometimes the designers could be backed up. You know what I mean?  
Me: This is actually, like, the perfect example of the second part of it. But maybe this is what we just make the product into then because this is, like,  
Them: Yeah. Let me, share  
Me: pretty straightforward.  
Them: share both of these with you real quick. Let me  
Me: I haven't even tested it, but I'm pretty sure it's gonna be do okay. It's not gonna be perfect, but  
Them: save it. Yeah.  
Me: it'll work. I'm just gonna pull straight into the code base, see it from the back end. Let's see here.  
Them: Okay. Let me save this and then I'll I'll send a team one minute here.  
Me: Cool. Yeah.  
Them: I'm gonna turn my video off. It fucking slows down whenever have video. So  
Me: I'll get  
Them: So k. Where we at here? Okay. I'm sending this to you right now. Sorry.  
Me: Is all good?  
Them: And then, yeah, you can just kinda play with it. But I'll send you the plan set. And then, you know, some of this stuff too, there might be another like so for example, there's a plan set, and then there might be engineering documents. So there could be another document, which I don't have. I don't know for sure, but just FYI, there could be corrections for another PDF, which is fine. Because as long as you feed it that PDF, it it'll go find the information. You know what I mean?  
Me: Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. It also should it's actually getting pretty cool. You got five minutes or you gotta you gotta bail? If you gotta bail  
Them: I I've gotta bounce pretty soon, but I can send you this.  
Me: you know. Yeah.  
Them: And then just review it, and then we can hop on another call. What I wanna do is why don't why don't you review this, and then we'll set up a call with Mario That that way, you know, you  
Me: Yeah. Let's do that.  
Them: you you kinda know how this works. And then, after that, we can kinda ask Mario, like, hey. What's your problems? What do you see? How do you see this working? And then you can show him right on the spot like, hey. Here's what this does. You know?  
Me: Yeah. The corrections won because that that might be the way to go because this is gonna work. Which is, like, really quickly. Whereas, like, the builder one, takes a lot more, or the the permit builder takes a lot more, like, if if you're if you're in your world, like, you want something like that, you get that letter and you're like, hey. Got these plans and it's, like, hard to figure out what we need to do.  
Them: Mhmm.  
Me: And you want it corrected. Like, the AI can do this. Like, I already kinda have a setup for this. So that's kinda cool.  
Them: Yeah. Yeah. Oh, for sure. And like I said, dude, if there's a way you can integrate this with the cities, like because, dude, if you sell if you sell some sort of software to the cities, like,  
Me: Yeah. The top part is every city's different.  
Them: that's you know? It's a ton of  
Me: Right? So the good part is, like, I could run a pilot program with, Buena Park possibly.  
Them: Yeah. Yeah.  
Me: We'll see what happens. But, dude, the pro yeah. The shitty part I always hate about that stuff is, like, sort of, like, get with the city is, like, know, like a quick process with the with, like, even Buena Park, and I have the inside info, be, fucking year because I'd have to, like, pass, like, fucking all these things. I have to, like, do  
Them: Oh, I I I  
Me: diversity shit. You know?  
Them: It's just yeah. It's it's it's a bunch of bullshit. And and, honestly, I don't think  
Me: So it's like, I know, dude. It's insane, dude.  
Them: they want AI because they wanna waste your tax money. So it's like,  
Me: Oh my god. I doubt it. And but but it's big money on the ones that So oh, wait. Never mind. That's the okay. That's HCU. Okay. Second revision corrections, and then binder for Jefferson. Cool. Second review. Sick. Okay.  
Them: Yeah. So just go through there. And like I said, this is the full plan set. With basically the corrections they came back with. So  
Me: Fuck at it. Alright.  
Them: it should be able to read, you know, some of that, but just play around with it, and then like I said, what I'll do is I'll, I'll hit Mario, and then let's just do a Zoom call with him. And he can like I said, he's gonna be better at explaining, like, hey. Here's where I can see this working. Here's where I can you know, he's gonna be a a better voice of reason for this  
Me: Yeah. Well, how about for this one? Can I just well, here's where I'm gonna come back with that Lisa originally is? I'm gonna take your current plans  
Them: Mhmm.  
Me: and then it's gonna come back to you with it fixed according to the letter.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: And, and if it doesn't have the info to make the fix, it's gonna come with, like, a letter saying, hey. This is what you need to do exactly.  
Them: Yeah. Basically, like, a list. Like, hey.  
Me: You know? Yeah. Yeah. That or that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So  
Them: Need to give me this or this or that. Yeah.  
Me: because that's actually so it was actually the way when you looked at that landing page. It was yeah. That's what it's we're far off from, like, actually doing it, but, like, like, hypothetically, I was thinking, like, $99 for the initial plan set. And then when the city's set of revision comes in, you just, like, top you get one free revision and then $30 extra after that. Do you think people would pay just for pure revisions? Like, they go submit the plan and then they need a revision.  
Them: What would they what do you think the market price would be for paying for something like that?  
Me: Yeah. Or like neighbor in town.  
Them: I yeah. Honestly, this I I would just do by how many revisions.  
Me: I got  
Them: Honestly. Right? Because if it's just, like, a few, like, because some of them are like, oh, can you label this? It's like, you know, they're not gonna pay money, like,  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: for just put in a little label. But sometimes it's, like, 20 revisions, and sometimes it requires a bunch shit. You know what I mean? So it just depends. Yeah. But I would I would maybe charge by revision. And so and here's the thing. Some revisions are more extensive than others. So  
Me: Yeah. That's a good point. I mean, honestly, though, the AI is, like, it's well, yeah. Okay. So someone came in and then it's like, they they bullshitted. Yeah. That's what you'd have to watch out for is something that's like 60 revisions. Right?  
Them: Yeah. And and usually, it's not. Usually, it's, like, 10, you know, five,  
Me: So this one, 14. Right? Yeah.  
Them: So yeah.  
Me: Okay.  
Them: And then a quest and then a question you might wanna ask  
Me: Get it.  
Them: Mario is like, hey. How do we systemize this per city? To minimize corrections? Right? And sometimes, like, I've been trying to ask designers about this because a lot of times it's like, oh, can you specify what type of succo? Right? And it's like, well, why the fuck don't we specify that in the beginning? Just so we don't have the correction of that? You know what I mean? Like, let's get ahead of the horse here and just put as much information as possible That way, there is no corrections because every time there's a correction, it's another fucking sixty days for them to  
Me: I know. That's so crazy, dude.  
Them: review. You know? And and that's another thing. It's like, why why for this stupid correction, the wife will wait another sixty days for you to fuck correct it. It should be, oh, cool. You're good. You know? Like, I don't know.  
Me: Yeah. No. Absolutely. So that's fucking wild, dude.  
Them: Yeah. But I'll, but I I gotta bounce, but I'm gonna send an email with  
Me: I'm gonna let this thing go, like,  
Them: us and Mario and then play with this, and then we'll bring this up on our call.  
Me: Cool.  
Them: Then he'll be able to kinda guide you on that. But, yeah, dude, I think I mean, the whole reason I wanted to, like,  
Me: Appreciate it.  
Them: kinda share this with you, I think there's an opportunity if you wanted to pursue it. Right?  
Me: Yeah. Exactly. That's where I'm I'm exploring. And then because I'm I already built this one This is basically, like, a templated software that worked really well for  
Them: In this market.  
Me: demand letter. That's why I've been just looking for, like, different buckets, then I just throw a Stripe thing on it, and it's all automated. It's kinda cool.  
Them: You should hit my buddy, Sergio. He's a lawyer. He does a he he does  
Me: Oh, nice. Yeah.  
Them: personal defense, immigration, and and he he actually does a lot of real estate law now. But I'll  
Me: Yeah. Defense is  
Them: I'll hitch I'll connect you with him as well.  
Me: tough because they charge by hours, so it's like the pitch you know, the efficiency pitch doesn't work  
Them: He he's he's mostly reimmigration.  
Me: great with it. Okay. Okay. Actually, that would yeah. I could definitely do forms for immigration. Yeah. If that's  
Them: Yeah. Yeah. His parents do immigration, and then right now, he's doing a lot of tenant You know how big of a scam that is, the whole tenant, Los Angeles, you know, landlord scam. It's just dude, it's a fucking racket, bro.  
Me: Yeah. Yeah.  
Them: Like so yeah, anyways, we'll all but, yeah, play around with that. Also,  
Me: Wow.  
Them: send a email right now with Mario, and then we'll we'll go from there.  
Me: Alright. Sounds good, brother. Talk to you later.  
Them: Alright, dude. Later.
