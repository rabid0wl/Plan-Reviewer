## The Problem

California doesn't just have a housing crisis — it has a **permit crisis**. On both sides:

- **Cities** are drowning in permit applications with not enough staff to review them. Each submission takes hours of careful, liability-heavy review.
- **Contractors** are builders, not lawyers. California permit requirements are dense, complicated, and effectively demand legal expertise to navigate.

The result: ADUs (Accessory Dwelling Units) — one of the best tools for adding affordable housing — are getting bottlenecked by bureaucracy. These are small apartments homeowners can build on their property to create cheap housing and earn extra income, but the regulatory overhead is killing momentum.

## The Insight

Most permit rejections aren't about structural engineering failures. They're about missing signatures, absent stamps, overlooked code citations — basically spell-check-level stuff at a building scale. Over 70% of permits get rejected on first submission, and the corrections letters that come back are dense, code-citation-heavy documents that contractors struggle to parse.

AI can handle this.

## What CrossBeam Does

### For Contractors & Homeowners

1. **Permit Checklist Generator** — Give us an address, and we look up zoning, city regulations, and state requirements to produce a clear checklist of everything needed before you submit.

2. **Corrections Letter Interpreter** — Upload your submitted permit and the corrections letter you got back. CrossBeam tells you exactly what to fix, what you can handle yourself, and what you need to get from your engineers/designers.

### For Cities (Open Source)

3. **AI Permit Pre-Screening** — Before a human reviewer spends hours on a submission, CrossBeam catches the ~90% of issues that are straightforward (missing documents, unsigned pages, absent engineer stamps, incomplete forms). The contractor gets a corrections letter back fast, fixes the easy stuff, resubmits, and *then* a human reviewer handles what actually requires expertise.

## Why It Matters

- Contractors stop playing lawyer and get back to building
- Cities process permits faster without adding headcount
- Homeowners actually get their ADUs built
- More housing gets added in California

## Context

Open-source project built for the Claude Code hackathon. ADU-focused to start, with potential to expand to other permit types.
