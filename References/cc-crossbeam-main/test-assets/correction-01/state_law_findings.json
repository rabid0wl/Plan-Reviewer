These values determine the minimum waste line sizing required to serve the total fixture load. When adding an ADU with new plumbing fixtures (bathroom, kitchen sink, etc.), the total DFU count must be calculated for the combined primary dwelling + ADU to verify the existing building drain/sewer lateral is adequately sized. The 2nd review comment specifically requires: (1) showing the size of the existing waste line and justifying it for the increased DFU demand, (2) showing the existing water meter and supply line size and justifying adequacy for increased plumbing fixture demand, and (3) showing the point of connection.",

Minimum building drain sizes: 3-inch drain handles up to 42 DFU; 4-inch drain handles up to 216 DFU.

However, this project is a NEW DETACHED ADU, not a conversion — so Gov. Code 66324(e) applies: a new or separate connection directly from the utility to the ADU may be required. Gov. Code 66324(e) also requires that connection fees/capacity charges be proportionate to the ADU's burden, based on square footage or plumbing fixtures compared to the primary dwelling.

The correction item requires updated wind calculations to verify that the covered landing patio is designed for C&C wind forces. This involves determining: (1) basic wind speed for the site (from ASCE 7-16 wind speed maps or local amendment), (2) exposure category, (3) effective wind area, (4) external pressure coefficients (GCp) from ASCE 7-16 Figure 30.11-1 through 30.11-7 depending on roof geometry, and (5) resulting design wind pressures on the patio roof components, connections, and cladding.",

Exposure categories B (urban/suburban), C (open terrain), or D (coastal) affect velocity pressure. The section requires calculating net pressure coefficients for zones based on distance from edges and corners of the open roof. Brace angle, lag screw connections, and post sizes must be verified against these calculated wind loads.",

For structures within 5 feet of a property line (or imaginary property line), the code requires: (1) exterior wall must have 1-hour fire-resistance rating on the exterior side, (2) projections (eaves, overhangs, covered patios) must have 1-hour fire-resistance protection on the underside if they project into the fire separation distance zone, and (3) openings (windows, doors) are generally not permitted or must be fire-rated assemblies. The correction specifically notes the covered landing patio is within 5 feet of the imaginary property line and requires 1-hour fire protection on the underside.",

Additionally, the 4-foot maximum rear/side setback (Gov.

This is expected — the skill references cover ADU ENTITLEMENT law (Government Code 66310-66342), which governs zoning, permitting process, and development standards. The cited code sections are BUILDING CODE requirements (professional licensing, plumbing sizing, structural wind loads, fire-resistance ratings) that apply to all residential construction, including ADUs. The bridge between them is Gov. Code 66314(d)(8), which confirms that ADUs must comply with all applicable building codes. The only ADU-specific exception relevant to these corrections is the fire sprinkler exception in Gov. Code 66314(d)(12), but that does NOT apply to CRC R302.1 fire separation (which is about wall/projection fire-resistance, not sprinkler systems). Notably, the 4-foot maximum rear setback (Gov. Code 66314(d)(7)) creates a common situation where detached ADUs are within the 5-foot fire separation distance of CRC R302.1, making the item 14 correction a frequent issue for ADU projects. For the 600 sq ft new detached ADU at 1232 N Jefferson St, Placentia: all four building code requirements apply without ADU-specific exceptions."
