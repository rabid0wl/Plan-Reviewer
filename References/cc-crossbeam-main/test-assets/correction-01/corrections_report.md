### Key Findings from Contractor Answers

**Item 4 — Sewer capacity is fine.** Existing 4" ABS line at 22 DFU + ADU 12 DFU = 34 DFU total. A 4" drain handles 216 DFU per CPC Table 702.1, so the combined load uses only 16% of capacity. No upgrade needed.

**Item 4 — Water meter is adequate.** 3/4" meter with 3/4" supply line serves the main house. A 600 sq ft 1BR ADU adds modest demand (4-6 GPM peak). 3/4" meter rated for ~30 GPM.

**Item 11 — Drainage works naturally.** FF at 103.10' is 3-10" above all corner grades. Property slopes SW toward alley. South side concrete patio gets 2% minimum slope; landscape sides get 5% minimum. Integrates with existing swale along south property line.

**Item 14 — New construction simplifies fire detail.** Patio is not yet built, so designer can specify fire-rated assembly from scratch rather than designing a retrofit.
