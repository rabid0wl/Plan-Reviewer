A note at the bottom references 'new water meter' in the scope of work on the cover sheet, but the actual utility line paths are not drawn on this site plan.

The South and North elevations show eave sides (horizontal roofline). However, the correction states these are reversed. This suggests that based on the actual building orientation on the site plan, what is labeled as the 'West Elevation' should actually show an eave side (not a gable), and vice versa. The roof ridge direction on the roof plan (upper-right) would need to be cross-referenced with the site plan orientation to confirm which faces are gable vs. eave. The labels on the elevation views may need to be swapped or the elevation drawings themselves may need to be corrected."

If a covered patio exists at the entry, it should appear as a distinct lower roof element (likely a shed roof or flat roof) rather than a continuation of the main gable rafters. The roof plan needs to be revised to show: (1) the covered landing patio as a separate lower roof structure, (2) the break between the main roof and the patio roof, and (3) appropriate framing indication for the patio cover."

Since the covered landing patio is near the property line (likely within 5 feet based on typical ADU setbacks), it requires a 1-hour fire-rated exterior wall assembly per CBC. The detail needs to show: (1) fire-rated wall assembly (e.g., 5/8 Type X gypsum board on the interior, fire-rated sheathing), (2) fire-rated eave/soffit detail if the overhang is within the setback, (3) specific callouts for fire-rating materials and assemblies. The current generic wall section does not address fire-resistance requirements for the property-line-adjacent condition."
