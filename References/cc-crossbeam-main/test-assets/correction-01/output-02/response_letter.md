>
> "2nd Review Comment: show/justify: Adequacy of existing waste line due to increase to the number of plumbing fixtures (show the size, justify the size for the new demand). Adequacy of the existing water meter and line due to increase to the number of plumbing fixtures (show the size, justify the size for the new demand, and show point of connection)."

**Response:** Sheet A1 (page 4) has been revised to show all utility line connections from existing services to the ADU with sizes, routing, and points of connection.

**Sewer — DFU Justification:**
- Existing waste line: 4" ABS
- Existing DFU load (main house): 22 DFU
- ADU additional DFU: 12 DFU (water closet 4 + shower 2 + lavatory 1 + kitchen sink 2 + clothes washer 3)
- Combined total: 34 DFU
- 4" drain capacity per CPC Table 702.1: 216 DFU
- **34 DFU is well within the 216 DFU capacity of the existing 4" ABS drain. No upgrade required.**

**Sewer — Connection:**
Wye fitting into existing 4" ABS lateral, approximately 15' north of main house cleanout near back porch. New two-way cleanout at connection point. New 4" ABS from ADU to connection at 2% minimum slope. ADU Sewer Connection Detail per City of Placentia standard shown on Sheet A1.

**Water — Justification:**
- Existing water meter: 3/4"
- Existing supply line: 3/4" copper
- **3/4" meter and supply line is adequate for single-family residence plus 600 sq ft ADU.**

>
> "2nd Review Comment: Provide additional information for the braces supporting the beam at the covered landing patio. Show the angle of the brace supporting the beam. Detail the lag screw connection between the brace to beam and brace to post. Show the required posts supporting the braces on the framing plan and list the post size. Provide updated calculations to verify that the covered landing patio is designed for component and cladding wind force per ASCE 7-16 section 30.11."

**Response:** Structural Engineer J. Gonzalez has provided updated structural details and calculations for the covered landing patio. The patio cover is new construction: 6' wide x 4' deep shed roof, 8' height at posts, attaching to ADU wall at 9'-2". Two 4x4 posts on concrete pier footings.

Updated details include:
- Post locations (2 ea. 4x4) and pier footings shown on Sheet S1 (page 10) framing plan

### 2nd Review Comments

**Item 9 — City of Placentia Municipal Code on Cover Sheet**

> "Add 'City of Placentia Municipal Code' to the Governing Codes on the Cover Sheet."

**Response:** "City of Placentia Municipal Code" has been added to the Governing Codes list on Sheet CS (page 1) alongside the existing state-level California building codes.

---

**Item 10 — "For Reference Only" on Grading Sheets**

> "Add 'For Reference Only' to all the Grading Sheets."

**Response:** "FOR REFERENCE ONLY" notation has been added to Sheets A1 (page 4) and A1.1 (page 5) where grading and drainage information is shown, as grading is depicted on architectural plans not prepared by a licensed civil engineer.

---

**Item 11 — Drainage Slope and Direction**

> "Provide the drainage slope and direction around all portions of the ADU (5% at landscape or 2% at hardscape away from the foundation)."

**Response:** Drainage plan with spot elevations, slope percentages, and flow direction arrows has been added to Sheets A1 (page 4) and A1.1 (page 5).

| Location | Finish Grade | Drop from FF (103.10') | Surface | Min. Slope |
|----------|-------------|------------------------|---------|------------|
| NE corner | 102.85' | 0.25' (3") | Landscape | 5% |
| NW corner | 102.60' | 0.50' (6") | Landscape | 5% |
| SE corner | 102.50' | 0.60' (7.2") | Concrete patio | 2% |
| SW corner | 102.30' | 0.80' (9.6") | Landscape | 5% |

- Finished floor elevation: 103.10' — minimum 3" above highest adjacent grade (NE at 102.85')
- All perimeter grades below finished floor — positive drainage away from foundation on all sides
- South side: concrete patio entry slopes at 2%+ toward existing swale along south property line
- North, East, West sides: landscape/planting beds slope at 5%+ — property drains gently southwest toward alley
- Existing swale along south property line carries runoff to street. No standing water issues.

See revised Sheets A1 (page 4) and A1.1 (page 5).

**Item 12 — Elevation Views / Roof Plan Mismatch**

> "Elevation views do not match the roof plan. Appears that gable ends and eaves are reversed on the elevation views. Please review and revise."

**Response:** Designer C. Sanchez has cross-referenced the roof ridge direction with the site plan orientation and corrected the elevation view labels on Sheet A3 (page 7). Gable ends and eave sides now match the actual building orientation as shown on the roof plan and site plan.

See revised Sheet A3 (page 7).

---

**Item 13 — Roof Plan — Covered Landing Patio**

> "Revise the roof plan to show the low roof covered landing patio. Current roof plan appears to show an extension of the roof rafters and is inconsistent with the elevation views and structural sheets."

**Response:** Roof plan on Sheet A3 (page 7) has been revised to clearly show the covered landing patio as a distinct lower shed roof element, separate from the main gable roof. The patio roof is shown with a clear break from the main roof structure, consistent with the corrected elevation views and structural Sheets S1/S3.

See revised Sheet A3 (page 7).

---

**Item 14 — Fire Protection for Covered Landing Patio (CRC R302.1)**

> "Covered landing patio is within 5' of the imaginary property line. 1-hour fire protection is required for the underside of the covered landing patio (CRC R302.1). Please show on the plans and provide a detail. Note, detail 2/A3 does not match the condition at this location and is not valid to address this comment."

**Response:** A new fire-rated assembly detail has been provided on Sheet A3 (page 7), replacing the previously rejected Detail 2/A3 for this condition. The covered landing patio is new construction. The new detail shows a 1-hour fire-rated assembly on the underside of the patio soffit: 5/8" Type X gypsum board applied to the underside of 2x rafter framing per CRC R302.1. The fire-rated condition is called out on both the elevation views and the roof plan on Sheet A3.

See revised Sheet A3 (page 7) — new fire-rated soffit detail.
