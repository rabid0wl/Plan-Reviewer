### Key Specifications

**DFU Justification Note (ready to paste onto Sheet A1):**
```
SEWER CAPACITY JUSTIFICATION:
Existing 4" ABS waste line serves 22 DFU (main house).
ADU adds 12 DFU (WC=4, shower=2, lav=1, KS=2, CW=3).
Combined: 34 DFU. 4" drain capacity per CPC Table 702.1: 216 DFU.
34 DFU << 216 DFU — existing line adequate, no upgrade required.

WATER SUPPLY:
Existing 3/4" meter, 3/4" copper supply.
3/4" adequate for SFR + 600 SF ADU.
```

**Sewer Connection (for Sheet A1 site plan):**
- Wye fitting into existing 4" ABS lateral
- ~15' north of main house cleanout near back porch
- New two-way cleanout at connection point
- 4" ABS from ADU to connection, 2% min. slope
- Reference City of Placentia standard ADU Sewer Connection Detail

**Water Connection (for Sheet A1 site plan):**
- New 3/4" copper tee off existing 3/4" supply at north side hose bib
- 35' run along side yard to ADU
- Isolation valve at tee and at ADU entry

**Grade Elevation Table (for Sheets A1/A1.1 drainage plan):**

| Corner | Finish Grade | Drop from FF (103.10') | Surface | Slope Req'd |
|--------|-------------|------------------------|---------|-------------|
| NE | 102.85' | 0.25' (3") | Landscape | 5% min |
| NW | 102.60' | 0.50' (6") | Landscape | 5% min |
| SE | 102.50' | 0.60' (7.2") | Concrete patio | 2% min |
| SW | 102.30' | 0.80' (9.6") | Landscape | 5% min |

- South side: concrete patio drains toward existing swale along south property line
- N/E/W sides: landscape beds, property slopes SW toward alley
- All sides have positive drainage from foundation

**Fire-Rated Soffit Detail (for Sheet A3 — replaces Detail 2/A3):**
- Condition: covered landing patio within 5' of imaginary property line
- Assembly: 5/8" Type X gypsum board on underside of 2x rafter framing
- Rating: 1-hour fire protection per CRC R302.1
- New construction — design from scratch (no retrofit)

**Patio Cover Architectural Info (for Sheet A3 roof plan and elevations):**
- 6' wide x 4' deep shed roof
- 8' height at posts, attaching to ADU wall at 9'-2"
- Two 4x4 posts (structural engineer details connections)
- Show as distinct lower roof element on roof plan — NOT an extension of main gable rafters

### Deliverables
- [x] DFU justification note for Sheet A1
- [x] Grade elevation data for drainage plan
- [x] Patio cover dimensions for structural coordination
- [ ] Sheet CS — add municipal code to governing codes, update sheet index
- [ ] Sheet A1 — utility connections with sizes, routing, sewer detail, water POC, drainage info, "FOR REFERENCE ONLY"
- [ ] Sheet A1.1 — drainage plan with elevations, slopes, arrows, "FOR REFERENCE ONLY"
- [ ] Sheet A3 — correct elevation labels (gable/eave), revise roof plan (patio as separate low roof), new fire-rated soffit detail
- [ ] All architectural sheets — stamp, sign, date (FINAL STEP)
