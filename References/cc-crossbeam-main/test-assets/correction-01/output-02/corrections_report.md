### Key Findings from Contractor Answers

**Sewer capacity is fine.** Existing 4" ABS waste line serves 22 DFU. ADU adds 12 DFU (toilet 4, shower 2, lavatory 1, kitchen sink 2, clothes washer 3). Combined 34 DFU is well within the 216 DFU capacity of a 4" drain per CPC Table 702.1. No upgrade needed.

**Water meter adequate.** 3/4" meter and 3/4" supply line is adequate for SFR plus 600 sq ft ADU. New 3/4" copper line tees off at north side hose bib, 35' run to ADU with isolation valves at both ends.

**Sewer connection is straightforward.** Wye fitting into existing 4" ABS lateral, 15' north of main house cleanout. New two-way cleanout at connection. 4" ABS at 2% slope from ADU. Standard detail per City of Placentia.

**Drainage works naturally.** Property slopes gently southwest toward alley. Existing swale along south property line carries runoff to street. No standing water issues. Finished floor at 103.10' is minimum 3" above highest adjacent grade (NE at 102.85'). All four corners drain away from foundation — south side at 2%+ (concrete patio), N/E/W sides at 5%+ (landscape).

**Patio cover is new construction.** 6' wide x 4' deep shed roof, 8' at posts, 9'-2" at ADU wall. Two 4x4 posts on concrete pier footings. Not yet built — designer and structural engineer can design from scratch (no retrofit complications).

                                                        STAMPS & SIGNATURES
                                                         (all sheets — last)
                                                                   │
                                                                   v
                                                                 SUBMIT
```

**All technical work can proceed in parallel.** Designer and structural engineer have no blocking dependencies between them. Sheet index update and "For Reference Only" notation wait on drainage work. Stamps and signatures are the final step across all sheets.
