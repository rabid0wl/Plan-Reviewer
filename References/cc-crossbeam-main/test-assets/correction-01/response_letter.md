All final drawings and calculations have been stamped and signed by the respective Registered Design Professionals:
- Architectural sheets (CS, AIA.1, AIA.2, A1, A1.1, A2, A3): Stamped and signed by C. Sanchez, Ideal ADU Design
- Structural sheets (SN1, SN2, S1, S2, S3): Stamped and signed by J. Gonzalez, PE (Job No. 25109)

**Item 4 — Utility Line Connections (Sheet A1)**

**Original Comment:** Provide utility line connections — water, sewer, gas, and electrical. City standard for sewer line connection.

**2nd Review Addition:** Show/justify adequacy of existing waste line and water meter/line for increased demand.

**Response:** Sheet A1 has been revised to show all utility line connections with sizes, routing, and adequacy justification:

**Sewer:**
- Existing building drain: 4" ABS lateral
- Existing DFU load (main house): 22 DFU
- ADU additional DFU: 12 DFU (toilet=4, shower=2, lavatory=1, kitchen sink=2, clothes washer=3)
- Combined total: 34 DFU
- **Capacity check per CPC Table 702.1:** 4" drain handles up to 216 DFU. Combined load of 34 DFU is well within capacity (16% of rated capacity). **Existing 4" ABS waste line is adequate — no upgrade required.**
- Connection method: Wye fitting into existing 4" ABS lateral, approximately 15' north of main house cleanout near back porch. New two-way cleanout installed at connection point. New 4" ABS line from ADU to connection, installed at minimum 2% slope. See City of Placentia standard ADU Sewer Connection Detail.

**Water:**
- Existing water meter: 3/4" meter with 3/4" supply line
- Proposed connection: New 3/4" copper line tee off existing 3/4" supply at north side hose bib, running 35' along side yard to ADU. Isolation valve at tee point and at ADU entry.
- **Adequacy justification:** A 3/4" meter (rated ~30 GPM) adequately serves a single-family residence plus a 600 sq ft 1BR ADU. Peak demand for the ADU (2 fixtures simultaneous) is approximately 4-6 GPM. Combined peak demand remains within meter capacity.

**Gas:** Gas line routing shown from existing meter to ADU. [See Sheet A1 for routing and size.]

**Electrical:** Electrical conduit routing shown from main panel to ADU sub-panel. [See Sheet A1 for routing.]

**Item 5 — Structural Details for Covered Landing Patio (Sheet S1, ASCE 7-16 §30.11)**

**Original Comment:** Provide calculations and structural details for new covered landing patio. Overhang/cantilever not detailed in structural plan sheet S1.

**2nd Review Addition:** Provide brace details, lag screw connections, post sizes on framing plan, and updated C&C wind calculations per ASCE 7-16 §30.11.

**Response:** Structural Engineer J. Gonzalez has revised the structural plans and calculations:

**Patio cover design:** 6' wide x 4' deep shed roof, 8' height at posts, 9'-2" at ADU wall attachment. Two 4x4 posts on concrete pier footings. New construction (not yet built).

- **Sheet S1 (Framing Plan):** Now shows two 4x4 post locations for covered landing patio, beam spanning the patio cover, and 4' depth dimension from ADU wall.
- **Sheet S3 (Structural Details):** New detail added showing:
  - Brace angle supporting the beam
  - Lag screw connection: brace-to-beam and brace-to-post with fastener schedule
  - 4x4 post size with post-to-pier footing connection
  - Attachment detail at ADU wall (ledger connection at 9'-2")
- **Calculations (Sheet 3 of 37):** Updated to include component and cladding wind force calculations per ASCE 7-16 Section 30.11 for the 6'x4' shed roof canopy structure. Verified all connections resist calculated C&C wind pressures.

### 2nd Review Comments

**Item 9 — City of Placentia Municipal Code on Cover Sheet**
"City of Placentia Municipal Code" has been added to the Governing Codes list on Sheet CS, alongside the existing state codes.

**Item 10 — "For Reference Only" on Grading Sheets**
"For Reference Only" notation has been added to all sheets containing grading and drainage information (Sheets A1 and A1.1), as the grading plan is shown on architectural plans and not prepared by a licensed civil engineer.

**Item 11 — Drainage Slope and Direction**
Sheet A1 has been revised to show drainage slope and direction around all portions of the ADU:

**Finished Floor Elevation:** 103.10'
**Finish Grade at ADU Corners:**
- NE corner: 102.85' (3.0" below FF)
- NW corner: 102.60' (6.0" below FF)
- SE corner: 102.50' (7.2" below FF)
- SW corner: 102.30' (9.6" below FF)

**Drainage Design:**
- All grades slope away from foundation at all corners — minimum 3" drop within the first 10' on all sides.
- **South side (concrete patio at entry):** 2% minimum slope away from foundation on hardscape. Grade drops from 103.10' at foundation to 102.50' at SE corner.
- **North, East, West sides (landscape/planting beds):** 5% minimum slope away from foundation. Grades drop from 103.10' at foundation to 102.60'-102.85' at building corners.
- **Overall drainage direction:** Property slopes gently southwest toward the alley, consistent with existing drainage pattern. Existing swale along south property line carries runoff to street. ADU drainage integrates with existing pattern — no ponding or redirection to neighboring properties.

Drainage arrows with slope percentages are shown on Sheet A1 at all ADU perimeter locations.

**Item 12 — Elevation Views vs. Roof Plan Coordination**
The elevation views on Sheet A3 have been reviewed and revised. The gable ends and eave sides have been corrected to match the actual building orientation shown on the site plan (Sheet A1) and the roof ridge direction shown on the roof plan. Elevation view labels now correctly reflect the building faces.

**Item 13 — Roof Plan Revision for Covered Landing Patio**
The roof plan on Sheet A3 has been revised to clearly show the low roof covered landing patio as a separate, distinct lower roof element:

- Main gable roof with ridge shown as before
- Covered landing patio shown as a separate 6'x4' shed roof at 8' post height (lower than the main roof)
- Clear break between main roof and patio shed roof at the ADU wall line (9'-2" attachment height)
- Consistent with revised elevation views and structural sheets (S1, S3)

**Item 14 — Fire Protection for Covered Landing Patio (CRC R302.1)**
The covered landing patio is within 5 feet of the imaginary property line. A new fire-rated assembly detail has been provided on Sheet A3, replacing the previous Detail 2/A3 which did not match this condition.

**New detail shows (new construction assembly):**
- 1-hour fire-rated assembly on the underside of the 6'x4' covered landing patio
- 5/8" Type X gypsum board applied to underside of patio roof framing (2x rafters)
- Fire-rated construction per CRC R302.1 Table R302.1(1) for projections within 5' of property line
- Fastener schedule: 1-5/8" Type S drywall screws at 12" O.C. into framing members
- Assembly is designed as new construction — not a retrofit
