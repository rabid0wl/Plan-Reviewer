## Section 4: Fire / Life Safety

### 20. Sprinkler Status — Clarify on Plans
**Sheet:** CS | **Confidence:** HIGH code / MEDIUM visual | **Action:** VERIFY

The cover sheet references fire sprinklers but the notation is unclear. Per Gov. Code 66314(d)(12), an ADU is not required to have fire sprinklers if the existing primary dwelling is not required to have them. Clearly state on the cover sheet: (a) whether the existing SFR has fire sprinklers, and (b) whether fire sprinklers are required for the ADU, citing the applicable code basis.

**Code:** Gov. Code 66314(d)(12); CRC R313

### 21. 1-HR Fire-Rated Construction — Verify Consistency
**Sheet:** A1, A2, A3 | **Confidence:** HIGH code / MEDIUM visual | **Action:** VERIFY

Plans note 1-HR fire-rated under-eaves and 1-HR fire-rated exterior wall (per CRC Chapter 7, Table 721.1(2), Material #15-1.3) due to proximity to property line. The site plan shows the ADU at 4 feet from the rear and side property lines. Verify that all exterior wall and eave assemblies within 5 feet of property lines are consistently detailed as 1-HR fire-rated per CBC Table 602, and that the construction type designation (item 10) is consistent with these fire-resistance requirements.

**Code:** CBC Table 602; CRC R302.1; CRC Table R302.1(1)

## Section 5: Structural [REVIEWER]

### 22. [REVIEWER: Verify Structural Adequacy]
**Sheet:** SN1, SN2, S1, S2, S3 | **Action:** COMPLETE

Structural sheets appear comprehensive with foundation plan, framing plan, shearwall schedule, holdown schedule, nailing schedule, and structural details. Engineer stamp (Gonzalez, Lic# C88762) is present. The following require licensed structural reviewer assessment:

- Foundation design adequacy for site soil conditions (plans assume 1000 PSF allowable soil bearing — verify soils report or default assumption is appropriate)
- Shearwall design and holdown capacities
- Framing member sizing and load path continuity
- Special inspection requirements completeness per CBC 1704/1705

### 23. [REVIEWER: Soils Report]
**Sheet:** SN1 | **Action:** COMPLETE

Structural notes reference 1000 PSF allowable soil bearing pressure. No geotechnical/soils report is referenced in the plan set. Determine whether a soils report is required for this project per city/county requirements, or whether the 1000 PSF default assumption is acceptable.

---

## Section 6: Process Notes (Informational — Not Plan Corrections)

### A. Public Works Approval Required Before Building Plan Check
Placentia requires Public Works submittal and approval (utility plan, grading permit documents, soils report) PRIOR to building plan check. Building plan check will not start until approval letters are received from both Planning and Public Works.

### B. School Development Fees
ADUs over 500 sq ft are subject to school fees at $3.48/sq ft (PYLUSD). This 600 SF ADU would owe school development fees.

### C. Deed Restriction
State law and/or Placentia Municipal Code may require a deed restriction to be recorded prior to permit issuance.
