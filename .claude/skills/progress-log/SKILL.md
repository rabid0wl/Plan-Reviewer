# Progress Log

Follow the repository protocol in `docs/PROGRESS_LOGGING_PROTOCOL.md`.

Minimum required in every qualifying session:

1. Update `PROGRESS.md` with details and validation evidence.
2. Update `PROGRESS_SUMMARY.md` with a concise synchronized summary.
3. Do not mark work complete without both updates.
4. Use Pacific time for all progress dates/timestamps: `America/Los_Angeles` (PST/PDT seasonally). For date-only entries, use the Pacific calendar date.
